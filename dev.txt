Follow-up measures were only obtained at 18 months post-training.	MissingData
Apart from the AAPPQ attitudes questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Minnesota Satisfaction Survey, the other measures (Knowledge, Self-Efficacy and Dual Diagnosis Attitudes) were devised specifically for the trial.	OutcomeMeasures
In terms of multiple testing there is a danger that some of the tests may yield significant results by chance alone.	StatisticalAnalysis
It is unclear whether all these elements were essential for the staff changes, or whether particular aspects more powerful than others.	Intervention
A further limitation was that there was no data on attendance at the supervision sessions; therefore no exploration of the impact of supervision can be made.	MissingData
However, it is possible that they may have shared their manuals and discussed elements of the training during clinical discussions at team meetings.	Blinding
As, however, we do not know the control parasite burden, these results are difficult to generalize.	OutcomeMeasures
The mechanism for this gain was not assessed by the present study design as we have no measure of faecal worm egg counts, but it may reflect a direct effect of deworming on nutrition.	OutcomeMeasures
In the present study the scale of weight gain that can be achieved in poor urban settings in India might be sufficient to contribute to reduced mortality, although a very large study would be needed to demonstrate this directly.	UnderpoweredStudy
Firstly, we did not include a placebo group and cannot exclude the possibility that the observed results reflect a placebo effect or the natural course of the condition.	Control
Secondly, local anaesthetics were not injected into the subacromial space to improve diagnostic accuracy.	Intervention
On the other hand, rotator cuff disease or subacromial shoulder pain is a clinical diagnosis and we used the recommended combination of clinical tests to improve patient selection.17 Thirdly, the study may be underpowered for detecting differences in the secondary outcome variables.

The lack of changes in serotonin stimulated endothelial function after treatment with carvedilol or metoprolol might be caused by the small number of patients included in the study.	UnderpoweredStudy
This a small interventional study with the purpose of finding changes in endothelial function between groups.	UnderpoweredStudy
A possible source of imprecision is that the Kato-Katz method has suboptimum sensitivity for diagnosis of intestinal helminth infections when one stool sample is used.	OutcomeMeasures
A possible source of imprecision is that data for doctor-diagnosed disease incidence were obtained passively, and therefore rates are likely to have been underestimated.	OutcomeMeasures
We also detected no evidence that anthelmintic treatment affected vertical transmission of HIV, although power to detect an effect was restricted.	UnderpoweredStudy
In the event, very few outcomes showed any evidence of association at a p value less than 0·05 so absence of adjustment for multiplicity is unlikely to have affected the interpretation of our results.	StatisticalAnalysis
This study examined only effects of maternal anthelmintic treatment on vaccine responses and disease incidence in newborn children.	OutcomeMeasures
First, we could not obtain adequate sputum samples in all patients at all time points.	MissingData
Even though the power of the study was adequate to address the primary objectives, it may not have been adequate to examine our secondary objective.	UnderpoweredStudy
Second, we can not exclude that our COPD group included patients who also had asthma.	Population
We excluded those with a previous history of asthma, but this may not have sufficed.	Population
Therefore, the test performance cannot be generalized to COPD patients on inhaled steroids.	Generalization
Finally, we did not include a second mannitol challenge for examining reproducibility of our results, which is a limitation of our design.	OutcomeMeasures
While sample sizes in the studies described here were relatively small, they were adequate to examine reliability and practical utility of the outcome measures chosen, were adequate for an exploratory RCT, and sufficient to power more definitive RCT in future.	UnderpoweredStudy
The number of tests carried out will have increased the probability of significant differences being observed by chance.	StatisticalAnalysis
It should also be noted that some of the significant differences which favored the intervention group in the present study were observed with small sample sizes and with outcome measures which had low reliability (e.g.	OutcomeMeasures

Ideally the results should be confirmed in a larger study, but because this trial took 10 years to recruit due to the difficulty of running a multicentre trial in slowly progressive glomerular disease, a similar larger study is unlikely to be done.	UnderpoweredStudy
Masking was impossible because of the nature of the treatments involved, but we accept that the fact that the study was unblinded might have affected the reporting of adverse effects.	Blinding
Slow trial recruitment was undoubtedly determined by the eligibility criteria: deteriorating renal function in idiopathic membranous nephropathy has become less common with angiotensin-cascade blockade and other aspects of supportive management, and our detailed communications with renal units throughout the UK during the trial showed that the rarity of eligible patients was the main barrier to recruitment.	Population
Recruitment was very slow and the trial was designed over 14 years ago.	UnderpoweredStudy
One aspect of the slow recruitment was the changes in methods that became established during the trial, both for estimation of excretory kidney function and assessment of proteinuria.	OutcomeMeasures

The biochemical dose–response curve would have been improved by the inclusion of other dose levels.	Intervention
Because of the high dose of vitamin D not previously studied in pregnancy, enrolment was limited to healthy women at low risk of pregnancy complications, and who were most likely to adhere to the protocol; as such, generalizability of the findings may be limited.	Generalization
Because of the high dose of vitamin D not previously studied in pregnancy, enrolment was limited to healthy women at low risk of pregnancy complications, and who were most likely to adhere to the protocol; as such, generalizability of the findings may be limited.	Population
In addition, enrolment was not conducted throughout the entire season, but rather occurred during a period in which vitamin D status was declining from its summer peak.	Population
Mechanistic inferences were limited because we did not measure serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D, vitamin D3, or DBP.	OutcomeMeasures
As well, we did not calculate total intake of vitamin D due to the lack of adequate information regarding vitamin D content in the Bangladeshi food supply.	MissingData
One limitation is that the trial allocation was of necessity open; lack of knowledge of CD4 in a child on clinically driven monitoring presenting with fever could have influenced decisions about hospital admission, given the plausible differential diagnosis of bacteraemia.	Blinding
Although open allocation was an unavoidable limitation of the monitoring randomisation and was not undertaken for the ART-strategy randomisation, the endpoint review committee adjudicated endpoints masked to randomisation.	Randomization
This scenario seems unlikely since substantial CD4 variability and complexity around toxicity test interpretation mean that simple rules for acting on routine test results are unlikely ever to be optimum.	OutcomeMeasures
Height measurements were not regularly monitored.	MissingData
That, and the short time interval between baseline and follow-up that was necessary for ethical reasons, are reasons why it was not possible to rigorously assess the association between sleeping impacts and height gain after dental treatment.	StudyDuration
That may be related to how dental pain was measured.	OutcomeMeasures
The number of children with dental pain at baseline and after dental treatment (n=36 and n=12, respectively) may have been too small to demonstrate a statistically significant association between dental pain and weight gain.	UnderpoweredStudy
The aforementioned factors were not assessed in this study, and may have influenced the rate of weight gain and its association with oral health-related impacts.	StatisticalAnalysis
Whether the relationship between the abovementioned covariates and weight gain are truly non-existent or if the non-significant findings resulted from the small sample size and effects of other medical, social and environmental factors, should be further investigated.	StatisticalAnalysis
Whether the relationship between the abovementioned covariates and weight gain are truly non-existent or if the non-significant findings resulted from the small sample size and effects of other medical, social and environmental factors, should be further investigated.	UnderpoweredStudy
A fair number of children were lost to follow-up, which may have affected the results as children who dropped out may have responded differently to dental treatment than those children who completed all stages of the study.	MissingData
The unequal distribution of gender in the study sample may also have influenced the results.	Population
Although a validated questionnaire was used to collect information on oral health-related impacts, there may have been bias in children’s self-reports.	OutcomeMeasures
The relatively small number of children in the study may have resulted in some weak associations between oral health-related impacts and weight gain and the time interval between surgical tooth extraction and follow-up may have been too short for children to gain much weight and height following treatment.

A cause-effect relationship cannot be deduced from the one-group pretest-posttest design.	StudyDesign
Myoglobin values peak within hours after a myocardial lesion and therefore were not detected at the time points of 4 hours and POD1.	OutcomeMeasures
Application of volatile anesthetics during surgery might reflect a certain bias for the study result.	Intervention
An important aspect of our study that must be considered is the fact that only biomarkers were analyzed.	OutcomeMeasures
Such trials would require large numbers of patients.	UnderpoweredStudy
First, it is known that the controlled substance propofol also has protective characteristics.	Control
Second, the postconditioning phase was relatively short (4 hours) and did not exceed this time interval.	Intervention
In addition, the applied dose of sevoflurane reflecting an age-adjusted 0.5 MAC was relatively low when compared with anesthetic doses during the operation and some supraanesthetic concentrations used in preconditioning settings [38].	Intervention
Third, as we were interested only in the per-protocol data, we did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis, which would imply a calculation of the data from all randomized patients, but a per-protocol analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, although chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are firmly linked with stratospheric ozone depletion and global atmospheric warming, halogenated anesthetics only contribute for a very small amount of man-made air pollution with these substances [39].	Intervention
While our study had a small sample size, it was interesting that those who were not smoking at 12 weeks and received extended IVR from weeks 13 – 52 had a 52.5% quit rate at 52 weeks.	UnderpoweredStudy
We were not able to follow-up with study subjects to find out why they lost interest with the IVR.	MissingData
Also, the opportunity to receive the varenicline at no charge may have attracted a select population.	Population
One limitation of our study was the fact that patient inclusion occurred during the learning curve of the leading surgeon; performing this trial at the beginning of the main surgeon’s training period most likely contributed to the LRH complication rate.	Intervention
Because we were not expecting any difference in the parametrial extension, we did not use any blinding.	Blinding
It is possible that the lack of a significant treatment effect may, in part, have been due to our study population; women were not selected for the study on the basis of suffering from severe or frequent hot flushes and/or other menopausal symptoms.	Population
We saw interesting potential gene–treatment effects for the changes in breast density and ESR1 polymorphism and FSH and CYP19 polymorphism, but the study was not powered to investigate these interactions and a larger study is needed to confirm these findings.	UnderpoweredStudy
However, a potential limitation of this study is that, although the study size was based on a case–control study of tamoxifen and breast density [19], changes in breast density among control individuals in this study were greater than anticipated.	Population
In addition, our findings may not be generalizable to the population as a whole.	Generalization
We did not include women in this study who were taking HRT at the time of recruitment (approximately one-third of women in the UK between the ages of 50 and 64 years use HRT [67]), and we only selected women with Wolfe P2 or DY breast patterns (which comprised approximately 60% of all mammograms classified for recruitment purposes).	Population
A further limitation of the study is that several statistical tests were carried out, and some of the statistically significant findings may have been due to chance.	StatisticalAnalysis
Withholding breastfeeding for an hour before and after may not have been feasible in this setting.	Intervention
Many infants would likely have been offered supplementary food or water and the intervention could inadvertently have interfered with the World Health Organization’s recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.	Intervention
This study was conducted with a limited population and the investigators did not measure the mothers’ understanding of the breastfeeding recommendations.	Intervention

Though the participants in this study represent an important group, the generalizability of the study is limited since all the participants were from one area of Delhi.	Generalization
Estimated ACR20 and ACR50 response rates at Week 12 were numerically higher in all OKZ treatment arms than PBO groups, although the study was not powered to show a statistical difference in the ACR response rates.	UnderpoweredStudy
The limitations of this study included the small number of patients in each treatment group and the resultant lack of statistical power for comparisons beyond the primary endpoint.	UnderpoweredStudy
This small sample size, along with the heterogeneity of the study population, resulted in high variability, quantified by the PBO groups.	Population

Although PBO patients were randomised to nominal ‘Q4W’ and ‘Q2W’ groups they received identical treatments at all visits and results in these groups (while demonstrating overall consistency with previous published RA clinical trials) were variable.	Intervention

Study duration is another potential study limitation given the long half-life of OKZ (31 days) and the time required to plateau plasma concentration drug levels.	StudyDuration
Additionally, in this study, all patients had previously been treated with, and failed to respond to, at least one TNF inhibitor, and thus, results seen here may not be directly applicable to the wider RA population.	Generalization

First, this was a single-center study.	Setting
Therefore, our results may not be generalized to patients in other ICUs, especially to nonsedated patients receiving pressure support ventilation.	Generalization
Second, the number of studied patients was relatively small.	UnderpoweredStudy
Third, because of the study design, namely the fact that every patient was its own control, we could not evaluate complications related to underinflation or overinflation of tracheal cuff.	StudyDesign
Fourth, we excluded patients who could not be included during the first 48 h of their invasive mechanical ventilation.	Population
Fifth, we did not collect P  values obtained manually during the routine care period and did not evaluate the relationship between manometer connection and any drop in P .	OutcomeMeasures
However, a sedation score would have been more appropriate in sedated patients.	OutcomeMeasures
First of all the sample size was relatively small and no sample size calculation was performed.	StatisticalAnalysis

Other limitations of this study are its non-randomized manner and all known drawbacks of registry studies.	Randomization
Nevertheless, these assessments of dose-proportionality should be interpreted with caution due to the large inter-subject pharmacokinetic variability and the small sample size (n=9) receiving 100 mg/kg/day.	Intervention

Performing a double-blind, controlled trial to test this system is clearly unfeasible; therefore we decided to use an open approach in which both the participants and medical team were aware of the interventions.	Blinding
Another limitation of the study was the absence of a follow up examination; consequently, we were unable to report whether the improvements demonstrated by the VR participants were maintained over time.	OutcomeMeasures
Finally, in light of the fact that this is a pilot study, the sample size was relatively small.	UnderpoweredStudy
We carried out the recruitment during the winter (November –January), which may have influenced the number of patients willing to participate.	Population
Another recruitment challenge was the inclusion criterion of at least four hours of daily leisure-time sitting.	Population
Of the 28 patients not meeting eligibility criteria after the telephone-based screening, 24 (86 %) were excluded because they reported less than four hours of daily leisure-time sitting.	Population
Accordingly, only four of the participants in our study were working.	Population
A limitation of the study was the lack of an active comparator, as previously observed by Carley and Body [38].	Control
An active comparator was not considered feasible in this study due to the unique mode of delivery and smell of methoxyflurane, as well as the difficulty in blinding possible inhaled comparators such as nitrous oxide.	Control
A double-blind, double-dummy study design would have been required for an active comparator, which would have had implications in terms of the time taken to dispense and administer study medication (when rapid analgesia is required in the ED), and also in terms of affecting the provision of rescue analgesia.	Blinding
Although the AMPLE trial was powered to compare abatacept and adalimumab directly, it was a single‐blind design, rather than double‐blind, which may have introduced bias 14.	Blinding
An additional limitation was the post hoc nature of the analyses that compared PROs in patient subgroups based on clinical response.	StatisticalAnalysis
It is, however, also important to emphasise that an inherent limitation of the glucose clamp method is the experimental and standardised setting, which imposes some challenges in directly translating to clinical practice.	OutcomeMeasures
Another limitation of the present study was the relatively few subjects per age group.	UnderpoweredStudy
Thus, it may be that the study sample did not provide enough statistical power to detect a smaller effect.	UnderpoweredStudy
The patients assigned to usual care were evaluated by the cardiologists at the heart failure centers every 6 months during follow-up, thus some contamination of the control intervention may be possible.	Control
In addition, the follow-up assessments of the patients' NYHA classification and 6-minute walk test were performed by assessors who were not blinded to the patients' assigned intervention.	Blinding
In other health-care systems with barriers to universal access, the study intervention might have proven more effective in reducing hospital re-admissions and deaths.	Generalization
However, because we had few events, we were unpowered to observe a potential statistically significant interaction between glucocorticosteroid and antibiotic groups.	UnderpoweredStudy
First, the antibiotic choice was not randomized, resulting in heterogeneous groups with differences in baseline characteristics including severity and admission to ICU.	Randomization
Second, the number of patients who received macrolides was small, hindering the possibility of a fully-adjusted analysis for proper comparison with patients who received fluoroquinolones and their interaction with glucocorticosteroids.	UnderpoweredStudy
Third, we did not measure baseline cortisol, which may be an important marker for measuring the effects of glucocorticosteroids.	OutcomeMeasures
It is also possible that the arm worn accelerometer did not capture the changes in PA or that an alternative output, such as increased mild/moderate PA specifically or a reduction in sedentary behaviour, may capture the changes due to the intervention.	OutcomeMeasures
A weakness is that we did not power the study for these secondary outcomes; nonetheless, the preliminary findings presented in the current paper, particularly the magnitude of improvements in fatigue, anxiety and depressive symptoms, the perceived impact of MS, strength and aerobic capacity, and cognitive processing speed, will inform future trials and targeted analyses of these important factors.	UnderpoweredStudy
A further strength is that we measured a broad range of MS symptoms, and reported the effect of the resistance and aerobic exercise programme on strength, fitness, and subjectively and objectively measured PA. A limitation is that the measures of objective PA and fitness did not change and a more direct measure of fitness, such as cycle ergometry to determine VO2 max, is recommended [50].	OutcomeMeasures
Participants reported some dissatisfaction with the SWA arm band; therefore, alternative tools for objectively measuring PA among PwMS are warranted.	OutcomeMeasures
A further strength is that we used exercise logs to capture intensity of aerobic exercise using steps from a pedometer, but a limitation is that we did not record heart rate and this is recommended in future trials.	MissingData
The primary limitation to these analyses is that hormone concentrations were not measured immediately following the weight loss period.	OutcomeMeasures
In addition, multiple comparisons may increase the false discovery rate.	StatisticalAnalysis
Assay of PON-1 provided an additional measure of the antioxidative function of HDL but no significant difference was found in the double-blinded randomised study in either arm at 1 year possibly due to the small sample size.	UnderpoweredStudy
Our study was not powered to assess the quantitative relationship between HDL function, inflammation and disease activity.	UnderpoweredStudy
This also limited our ability to test for between-treatment differences in the randomised study design, although combination therapy demonstrated a clear benefit in the single-blinded study.	UnderpoweredStudy
Limitations of this study were that this was a short-term (6 months) study in a single center and we only focused on hypoglycemia risk at CGM and we did not analyze the other blood glucose variabilities.	OutcomeMeasures

Therefore, the results may not be generalized.	Generalization
First, all of the non-diabetic control patients were dyspeptic, so that we could not investigate the role of dyspeptic symptoms in the development of gastric precancerous lesions.	Population
Furthermore, the other risk factors related to gastric cancer such as cigarette smoking, dietary habits, and body mass index were not available in controls.	Population
Second, the analysis of hypoglycemic drugs for precancerous lesions was limited to insulin.	Intervention
While the JCP intervention allowed us to assess demand for treatment refusals and their relationship with clinical and demographic factors, the sample was subject to the eligibility criteria for the CRIMSON trial.	Population
This took place in three urban and one rural area within the three sites and included only those with an admission in the last two years; the sample is therefore not fully representative of adults with psychoses using secondary mental health services in England.	Population
Further, we are unable to report the extent to which refusals were honoured due to the CRIMSON trial resource limitations.	MissingData
The most important limitation of this study is that it is a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial.	StatisticalAnalysis
Since randomization did not take socio-demography into account, this could have created imbalance between the randomization groups in relation to socio-demography, this does not seem to be the case.	Randomization
We although found a minor difference in randomization regarding residence that means one should be cautious when interpreting these results.	Randomization
It is also a limitation that some elements of the intervention in the structured care arm were later applied to the routine care arm through national diabetes guidelines.	Intervention
Information on educational level, employment and civil status were self-reported which might cause misclassification, but on the other hand, this information is readily at hand for the physician.	OutcomeMeasures
Furthermore, some of the reported socio-demographic differences in mortality and morbidity could be due to patients with low level of education, outside the labour market or living alone being diagnosed later in the natural history of diabetes [9, 37] and therefore presenting with a more advanced disease at diagnosis [13].	Population
Also a higher prevalence of comorbidity among patients with low SES in general could influence the result.	Population
Not all non-fatal outcomes have been tested for validity, but this is generally considered to be acceptable [29, 30], and differential misclassification according to treatment allocation and socio-demography is not expected.	OutcomeMeasures
Health literacy remains a concept that is difficult to assess and there is no tool universally accepted as the measurement standard [39].	OutcomeMeasures
Using a tool with a broader definition of health literacy, that goes beyond the ability to read and comprehend health information could have yielded different results [42, 43].	OutcomeMeasures
In addition, the questionnaires were self-administered which may have induced a social desirability bias.	OutcomeMeasures
Participants may have answered questions more positively than the reality of their situation.	OutcomeMeasures
Even though we followed current recommendations for the identification of patients [31], the intervention of family physicians in the selection process may have introduced a selection bias.	Blinding
This standardised outcome may have conflicted with the individualised approach in LC strategies.	OutcomeMeasures
The trial was carried out in western Denmark where the population in general is lower educated than the total population of Denmark and the trial enrolled patients with HF [35].	Population
The estimate may have been affected towards the null hypothesis as mutual interaction between the arms was plausible due to lack of blinding of the health professionals.	Blinding
Moreover, patient education was delivered in both arms and the effect of the patient education in the control arm may have contributed to even out the effect of LC strategies.	Control
However, no knowledge of the patients that declined was accessible and it was thus unknown if selection of the patients was present at enrolment.	Population
This caused limitation of the generalisability of the results and the trial was not able to provide answers about the effect on the total population of people with IHD or HF.	Generalization
Temporal and contextual factors affect the ability to RTW and influence the external validity of the outcome measure.	Generalization
The web system only managed to track the login frequency and time spent on the website.	Intervention
Another feature such as ‘e-Mail the Nutritionist’ was not extensively used.	Intervention
The trial was also not blinded, with patients and investigators knowing the treatment allocation.	Blinding
The selection of patients with DKAB score of less than 50% and HbA1c of more than 7% meant that only those in dire need of dietary education to improve their glycaemic control were included in this RCT.	Population
First, the high and differential loss to follow up may have introduced bias.	MissingData
Second, self‐reporting on compliance favours over‐reporting of consumption, which may lead to underestimation of effectiveness.	OutcomeMeasures
Third, our findings may not be generalisable to non‐urban Cambodian populations.	Generalization
Third, our findings may not be generalisable to non‐urban Cambodian populations.	Population
Finally, subgroup analysis of the effect of the specialised products specifically on MAM children was not undertaken due to low sample size.	UnderpoweredStudy
The fact that these surveys did not ask whether individuals ever injected drugs or ever shared injection equipment, coupled with the fact that more participants were HCV Ab positive at baseline (n=184) than those who reported injecting drugs (n=124), suggests that we underestimated the number of participants who engaged in these behaviors and who may be at high risk for HCV.	Population
In addition, the number of people achieving subsequent steps of the HCV care continuum (eg, linkage to care, and treatment initiation) in this study, particularly among high-risk participants such as those who share injection equipment, limited our ability to test the effect of A-CHESS on these important stages of care.	Intervention
Staging the disease in this manner did not allow us to estimate reinfection or HCV treatment failure experiences.	OutcomeMeasures
In addition, this logic allows participants to advance to the latest stage, achieving SVR, during the study period if they had received treatment before the study but had not undergone RNA testing in the year before enrollment and then received an RNA negative test during the study period.	Intervention
Our team experiences enrollment challenges at 2 of the 3 addiction treatment centers, primarily because of limited staffing.	Population
Owing to these enrollment challenges, 97% of participants were recruited from 1 center in the state of Massachusetts, limiting the generalizability of this study.	Generalization
Owing to these enrollment challenges, 97% of participants were recruited from 1 center in the state of Massachusetts, limiting the generalizability of this study.	Population
The primary treatment center is located in an urbanized area with a population size of approximately 89,000 residents [27], where HCV testing services may be more accessible than in rural communities.	Setting
Furthermore, only 2 participants were recruited in the state of Wisconsin.	Population
Another limitation of this study is the use of self-report.	OutcomeMeasures
This study would have been strengthened if serologic confirmation of HCV could have been obtained.	OutcomeMeasures
Consequently, most test dates were estimated.	OutcomeMeasures
The first is that the type of task used to assess attention may not be directly aligned with demands on working memory capacity.	OutcomeMeasures
A second consideration, which is of particular importance for the design of future research, is that the test-retest reliability of both of these outcome measures is poor.	OutcomeMeasures
In hindsight, it might be reasonable to suggest that the selection of Cogmed as the core training intervention in this trial was a suboptimal choice, particularly given that our results are inconsistent with effective core working memory training.	Intervention
There was a greater number of participant withdrawals from the Experimental Group than from the Active Control Group, which was likely in part due to the high demands of the adaptive working memory training tasks, compared with the low-demand nonadaptive version of the training.	MissingData
In a similar vein, despite our best efforts, average active training time was significantly greater for participants in the Experimental Group than the Active Control Group over the 5-week training period.	Intervention
Additionally, the rigid nature of the training procedure stipulated by Cogmed means that we are unable to identify whether different training durations, or tasks targeting alternative processes, would have resulted in improved training and transfer.	Intervention
Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the method of scoring for cognitive tasks can have important consequences for task performance.	OutcomeMeasures

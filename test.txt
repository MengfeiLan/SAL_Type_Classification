One possible reason for the lack of effect is that families did not comply with the intervention.	Intervention
Due to an ambiguity in the sampling protocol, we were unable, in this study, to obtain valid information on post-intervention house dust mite loads, but data from other studies show bedding covers of the sort we supplied to be highly effective in reducing mattress dust mite load.	OutcomeMeasures
[8] A further possible explanation could be that the patients recruited on average suffered relatively mild disease (reflected by their low baseline asthma symptom scores); they were therefore sufficiently well controlled on existing treatment for little scope to remain for clinical improvement (Table 2).	Population
We used PEF as our primary outcome measure of interest since this is the objective measure most commonly used by general practitioners and paediatricians; spirometry would not have been feasible in such young children.	OutcomeMeasures
Because of concerns regarding the validity of self-recorded PEF in children, however, we opted for nurse-supervised clinic based recording rather than early morning PEF, another possible explanation for our failure to detect a difference.	OutcomeMeasures
Because few resistant isolates were isolated in the current trial, we could not conclusively establish the in vivo effectiveness of tigecycline against organisms that typically convey resistance (eg, E. faecalis, methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp.).	Population
This trial had an inadequate sample size to demonstrate efficacy or safety.	UnderpoweredStudy
A limitation of our pilot trial in a regional perinatal center is that many potential subjects were transported already intubated.	Population
While a larger sample size would be required to more definitively define the multivariate form of the relationship between MTPM and joint loading, this is a first step in our understanding of joint function and TKA outcome.	UnderpoweredStudy
The unexplained variability in postoperative implant migration may be accounted for by the differences in other patient characteristics not included in the current analysis such as bone density, sex, bone morphology, implant sizing and positioning, realignment of the joint intraoperatively, and other surgical factors.	StatisticalAnalysis
This study provides an indication that preoperative gait dynamics are associated with postoperative movement of the implant within the bone, but it was limited in terms of the number of variables investigated.	StatisticalAnalysis
A second limitation of the study was sample size.	UnderpoweredStudy
While some statistically significant correlations have been identified, the study may have been underpowered to be able to detect statistically significant correlations with other metrics.	UnderpoweredStudy
The choice of a design with a standardised drug treatment and a placebo control required switching of drugs.	Intervention
However, as the overall prevalence of substance misuse is much lower in Hong Kong than in some other populations,46 we did not do regular laboratory monitoring of illicit substance use.	OutcomeMeasures
Finally, although quetiapine seems to be as effective as other antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of first episode psychosis,47 48 our design does not consider the question of the relative advantages or disadvantages of quetiapine compared with other antipsychotics as a maintenance treatment.	Intervention
Other atypical antipsychotics could be equally effective at a different cost, depending on regional pricing and availability of generic drugs.	Intervention
As a final consideration, this study specifically targeted a cohort of patients likely to have a better outcome, and for whom discontinuation of treatment was a realistic consideration.	Population
Although we did not recruit patients with residual psychotic symptoms, or those who already had at least one relapse, discontinuation in these patients would probably result in an even higher risk of relapse than found in this study.	Population
The low rate of substance misuse and high rate of employment in this group also need to be taken into consideration before generalising the findings to other settings.	Population
The definition of an active DU used in this trial may not match criteria used in other centres.	Population
The clinical utility of this promising approach to treatment may be challenged.	Generalization
First, colchicine 0.5 mg was only given for 16 weeks.	StudyDuration
The risk of flares following initiation of ULT is known to extend for up to a year or longer; thus a more prolonged period of colchicine prophylaxis may have been appropriate.	StudyDuration
Second, occurrence and duration of flares was dependent on patients’ assessment.	OutcomeMeasures
This reflects the fact that there are currently no validated endpoints for the assessment of gouty arthritis flares.	OutcomeMeasures
Third, the study population is probably not representative of all patients who would benefit from canakinumab.	Generalization
Fourth, allopurinol treatment was initiated at 300 mg (or 100 mg or 200 mg if creatinine clearance was <90 ml/min) instead of slowly up-titrating from a dose of 50–100 mg, as suggested in treatment recommendations.	Intervention
It was powered only to compare individual programmes with the comparator group, not to make head to head comparisons between programmes.	UnderpoweredStudy
Where we were unable to get an objective weight measurement, we asked participants to self report.	OutcomeMeasures
However, we do not believe that this will have led to overestimation of weight loss, as those who self reported their weight at the time of predicted programme end had a smaller weight loss than did those who provided an objective measure of weight, but some measurement error may exist.	OutcomeMeasures
The self reported physical activity seems high and, as reported previously,32 33 is likely to be an overestimate.	OutcomeMeasures
To increase the uptake and follow-up rates, we kept data collection to a minimum, so we do not have data on health outcomes or on the previous strategies for weight loss used by the participants.	MissingData
These are likely to be people who were most motivated to change.	Population
Attendance data were provided by the providers of the weight management programmes and could not be independently validated, so they may be subject to some errors.	OutcomeMeasures
The costs that we present are the direct costs of the programme to the primary care trust; we have not tried to determine cost to primary care from a change in consultation rates or drugs or the costs to the participants of attending the programmes or purchasing any products from the commercial programmes.	MissingData
We could not unpick the elements associated with greater weight loss in people who attended the commercial programmes.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, it must be noted that the Indian sample size is about 13% of the overall Asian phase III study, meaning that the Indian results are less precise than those obtained at the whole study level, determining cure rates to be estimated within wide confidence limits, even if the rate of success is similar to that reported using DP in other regions of Asia [9].	UnderpoweredStudy
One of the study limitations is that it was not blinded so that an influence on the evaluation of the tolerability cannot be excluded.	Blinding
One of the limitations of this study is the lack of children below 18 years of age.	Population
Based on the structural similarities of chloroquine and piperaquine, there was the theoretical potential for cross-resistance to chloroquine which might have resulted in a low response to DP.	Intervention
The sites where this research was undertaken were purposely selected and the infrastructural conditions differed greatly between them.	Setting
Pregnant women were recruited from within the communities with no other selection criteria except living in one of the study clusters, being pregnant and not planning to move away in the subsequent year.	Population
The HIV-positive sample in the study was fairly small, which limited our ability to conduct detailed sub group analysis.	UnderpoweredStudy
There may be other factors associated with breastfeeding cessation in our sample that we did not measure, such as advertising or promotion of formula in health facilities and communities.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, although this pilot study was not powered for generalizability, it did substantiate other reports that exercise and manual medicine care for PRLBP are beneficial with low associated risk [21,23,60].	UnderpoweredStudy
One major limitation was that the first author conducted all aspects of the trail including provision of care to all study participants.	Blinding
As a result, she was not blinded to intervention during the analysis phase, insufficient time was available for satisfactory recruiting, and treatment effects could be related to investigator proclivities rather than to the modalities themselves.	Blinding
Another limitation was that allowing women to enter the study at any point in their pregnancy made it difficult for latecomers to complete the treatment protocols before birth and also complicated the analysis.	Population
Toward the beginning of the study we also had difficulty retaining the first women who were randomized into the exercise treatment arm.	Population
Finally, the imputation method of last observation carried forward could bias the outcome in favor of the treatment group that had more people who withdrew early in the study or for the group with more women who arrived at their 8th study visit earlier in pregnancy.	StatisticalAnalysis
First, the sample size of the present study was relatively small.	UnderpoweredStudy
Second, selection bias that attracted motivated males in a stable relationship with an interest in treatment might have operated to yield a sample of men who are more likely to engage in safe sex practices.	Population
Selection bias may have been further compounded by attrition.	MissingData
Thus, the small sample size and the impact of both selection bias and attrition may have adversely impacted the ability to determine precise estimates of HIV and HCV in the population of non-substance-using female partners of injection-drug-using men.	Population

Third, a relatively large number of men who expressed an interest in participation in the parent study failed to enter the study: 19/74 (26%) failed to show up for their intake appointment, and 15/74 (20%) were determined to be ineligible.	Population
Because information on the women in the present study is gathered from the female partners of the male participants, such a relatively high rate of participant loss potentially limits the generalizability of the findings.	Generalization

Fifth, HIV and HCV status was based on self-report measures.	OutcomeMeasures
Sixth, there was a relatively large amount of missing data on for the questions regarding HIV and HCV status, because the women failed to answer these questions.	MissingData
Finally, information on sexual violence or abuse independent of physical violence was not collected.	OutcomeMeasures
Segments of human nerve material were obtained at biopsy and are thus potentially pathological.	OutcomeMeasures
A significant limitation of this trial was that a large number of families declined to participate.	Population
Another limitation to consider is that the sample might be biased towards those who had better support systems, more time and fewer competing responsibilities.	Population
Contamination is a potential limitation in this study.	Blinding
It was impossible to prevent some communication between subjects in the FNI and SC groups.	Blinding
A limitation of this report is that longer-term follow-up assessments of neurophysiologic and cognitive and behavioral development were not available.	MissingData
The only concerning result is that more patients were lost to follow-up in the Y-group (10 vs. 3; P = 0.04).	MissingData
The investigators were aware of the patients' group assignment when deciding on the need for unscheduled ICD follow-ups.	Blinding
A blinded approach, however, was not possible because all patient's data were needed to judge on the necessity of an in-office follow-up.	Blinding
Likewise, the QoL results could have been affected by the patient's knowledge of group assignment.	Blinding
Although we also assessed the number of patient contacts to other physicians (for concomitant diseases) based on patient diary and on interviews at each ICD follow-up, these data might have been biased towards less contacts reported in the Y-group because patients may have more difficulty in remembering all contacts since 12 months than since 3 months ago.	OutcomeMeasures
More than one-third of the enrolled patients did not reach the regular end of the study.	MissingData
On the other hand, a larger study cohort would have enhanced the accuracy of secondary endpoints evaluation.	UnderpoweredStudy
In addition, only half of the enrolled patients contributed to the QoL analysis; the rest of patients did not fill out the QoL questionnaire either at baseline or at a later time-point.	MissingData
REFORM results are not transferrable to patients receiving ICDs for secondary prevention or an ICD for CRT, who potentially have different needs for remote monitoring and for in-office follow-up visits.	Generalization
The follow-up duration of 27 months was insufficient to evaluate the results towards the end of the device's life cycle, when the risk of failures increases.	StudyDuration
To assess the efficacy in such patients, other outcomes than those we chose might be more feasible [35].	OutcomeMeasures
However, the scale combination has not been validated and, thus, we cannot be sure that it was sensitive to the intervention.	OutcomeMeasures
As with all service evaluations, blinding of assessments during hospital stay was impossible and may have introduced bias.	Blinding
Inclusion was terminated before the intended sample size aim was reached.	UnderpoweredStudy
This inevitably raised the awareness of delirium in the orthopedic ward.	Blinding

We covered screen time in classes only during the first year of the trial, which was possibly insufficient to produce a significant effect.	OutcomeMeasures
Educational classes were an important activity in this trial and the uptake of information could have been better in larger schools.	Setting
However, as the trial was not designed to analyze the moderating effects of the school characteristics on the intervention effects, the explanations for these effects are speculative.	UnderpoweredStudy
A limitation of this study is the large and unbalanced dropout.	MissingData
The assessment of physical activity in a sub-sample is an additional limitation.	MissingData
Although we blinded staff that measured outcomes to the allocation of the schools, we cannot rule out that they observed elements of the interventions such as the posters or the walking trail.	Blinding
We could only assess the use of the walking trail in two schools due to logistical constraints.	MissingData
In addition, the findings for the 20 m shuttle run and bent arm hang should be interpreted with caution since a post-hoc analysis showed a statistical power of 64% and 65% for these outcomes respectively.	UnderpoweredStudy
Further generalization of our findings is hence limited to urban schools in the regions that share these characteristics [65].	Generalization
It should be noted, however, that technical challenges during the conduct of this multicentre trial led to approximately 15% of the measurements being substandard.	OutcomeMeasures
Because of the severity of disease in study participants who had reduced mobility, contractures and joint pain, the procedure proved more difficult than anticipated.	OutcomeMeasures
The difference in SMS was not statistically significant, but it should be noted that this was a first in man study with a totally new product and because of safety reasons not powered to demonstrate differences between treatments.	UnderpoweredStudy

The overall smaller success in this target behavior could have been due to the inclinometer default setting which only registered breaks lasting at least 10 seconds; thus a sit-to-stand transition that involved less than 10 seconds of standing would not have been captured by the measurement device.

The follow-up is still short and, while most recurrences tend to arise in the first three years after treatment, nCRT delays the appearance of LR and it is possible that more patients may develop recurrence in the future.	StudyDuration

This study did not evaluate atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation, where the burden of disease is often greatest, nor did it quantify plaque lipid content.	OutcomeMeasures
Although MRI scans provide highly reproducible measures of plaque structure and vessel function, they offer no direct measure of plaque inflammation.	OutcomeMeasures
In this study, no attempt was made to select subjects on the basis of inflammatory status.	Population
Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that the dose of canakinumab was not high enough to generate a maximal effect on atherosclerotic burden, although the dose was sufficient to lower both hs-CRP and IL-6 levels.	Intervention
However, this small study cannot thoroughly or systematically evaluate the safety of canakinumab.	UnderpoweredStudy
We do recognise that although the FAOS has been refined and validated in various contexts,   the nature and extent of non-differential misclassification of the primary study outcome remains unknown.	OutcomeMeasures
Our extensive protocol might have introduced bias in the characteristics of participants in our study group.	Population
While we were successful in enrolling 504 patients, this represents a recruitment rate of one in three patients who met our clinical criteria of eligibility.	Population
We suspect that our time intensive appointments for outcome assessment might have contributed to the refusal of 232 eligible patients to participate.	Population
Another 129 eligible patients declined to participate because of travel distance, a consequence of our urgent care centres serving a large geographical region.	Population
As such, our sample might not be generalisable to all those who experience grade 1 and 2 ankle injuries.	Generalization
This study is limited by its single-center study design; therefore, our findings should primarily be viewed as hypothesis generating.	Setting
Despite the use of an observer and the lab timer, we cannot exclude a bias in the performance, measurement, or recording of the procedure or clinical data.	OutcomeMeasures
The second, the open-label design may increase the possibility of bias.	Blinding
That is, patients or operators may be influenced by their knowledge of the procedure.	Blinding
The current study did not directly compare the durability of the HWIB with the NDIB.	OutcomeMeasures

Accordingly, only recruits that volunteered and signed informed consent participated, and they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time.	Population
Because so many soldiers dropped out quickly without allowing their shoes to “break in”, the study methodology could not be completed.	MissingData

It is clear that designing the current study as a “medical intervention” necessitating medical regulations was not the optimal choice for initial evaluation of the new military boot [8].	StudyDesign
However, since one FFQ-item asked about “fruits and vegetables as snacks”, we were not able to describe the exact frequency of the consumption of vegetables and fruits.	OutcomeMeasures
The rather comprehensive FFQ used in the NFFD study requires a certain level of cognitive function to complete, and might not represent the best approach for including respondents with poor reading skills.	OutcomeMeasures
As the respondents were included in an intervention study aiming at optimising nutrition and physical activity, they might have over-reported their intake of FV.	OutcomeMeasures
The study was limited to nulliparous women, and was biased towards older age and higher educational attainment.	Population
Furthermore, the women in the NFFD study were mainly white European [26].	Population
This might reduce the external validity and the reproducibility of our results.	Generalization
The FFQ-item “vegetables at dinner”, might not capture mixed vegetable dishes, and thus underestimate intake of vegetables.	OutcomeMeasures

The data on pre-pregnancy diet was collected in retrospect, and thus we cannot rule out recall bias.	OutcomeMeasures
The women who consented to participate in the NFFD trial might have been more health-conscious and more likely to adhere to a healthy lifestyle, including an increased intake of FV, than the average pregnant woman.	Population
The increase in FV consumption might have been due to public health recommendations or symptoms specific to pregnancy such as cravings, tiredness or nausea [64].	StatisticalAnalysis
We did not take this into account.	StatisticalAnalysis
In populations with a higher intake the social gradients in consumption might have been less distinct [66, 67].	Generalization
The design of our study does not allow us to drawn conclusions about the efficacy of the use of technology for the behavioral change.	StudyDesign

Fifth, cardiac output assessed from pulse contour analysis may be inaccurate in relation to change in resistive and elastic characteristics of the vascular system, although its reliability is acceptable during the hour following calibration [43].	OutcomeMeasures
Finally, the lack of randomization between the three maneuvers performed to predict fluid responsiveness (namely Trendelenburg maneuver, VT challenge and EEO) could have hampered a reliable evaluation of the latter two tests.	Randomization
The study design was limited to a self‐reported questionnaire, and there was a lack of objective confirmation of these reported sleep‐related factors.	OutcomeMeasures
We did not assess how recently the overnight shift work was performed and whether the frequency of shift work changed after their ACS.	OutcomeMeasures
Although patients were followed for a median of more than 2 years, it is possible that additional cardiovascular risk would be more apparent with time.	StudyDuration
Although we adjusted for multiple variables, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding and therefore causality cannot be definitively demonstrated.	StatisticalAnalysis
We also acknowledge that physiological or behavioral mechanisms that are indirectly related to sleep disorders may contribute to the elevated risk of cardiovascular outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
The Berlin questionnaire has not been validated in a population of post‐ACS patients, but has been validated in small studies of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease patients.22 There could potentially be increased central sleep apnea in heart failure patients or increased sleepiness attributed to medical conditions, which might affect the estimate on risk on this screening questionnaire.	OutcomeMeasures
Despite being, to our knowledge, the largest randomized study on venous PTA in RRMS, the power of the study was limited.	UnderpoweredStudy
Thus, of the 15 centers that initially joined the trial, only 6 actively recruited.	Population
Second, many patients are reluctant to participate in a randomized sham-controlled study in spite of the fact that randomization was 2:1 in favor of angioplasty; this reluctance may have been exacerbated by the media, which overemphasized the effectiveness of venous PTA.	Population
Third, the sudden widespread availability of venous PTA (and stenting) in private centers decreased the number of patients fulfilling the inclusion criterion of no previous angioplasty.	Population
Another limitation of the trial is that the severity of the enrolled patients in terms of EDSS score and lesion load was lower than anticipated, and patients with active disease may have been underrepresented in the study (Table 1).	Population
Finally, the fact that venous PTA was largely ineffective in restoring blood flow in nearly half the patients in the PTA group suggests that it was inadequate for exploring our initial hypothesis.	Intervention
No further information was collected regarding the nature of the cerebrovascular disease.	OutcomeMeasures
Consequently, it is a recognised weakness of the study that it is not possible to further examine the data to understand the relationship of the underlying CVD pathology of the dementia to any effect of rilapladib.	OutcomeMeasures
This may reflect the insensitivity of the Aβ-related measures used in the present study, a lack of translation from the nonclinical model or a more dominant role of the cerebrovascular mechanisms on the observed treatment responses.	OutcomeMeasures

In contrast, several limitations should be acknowledged: (i) Although having a randomization goal of 126 ED patients, the study was stopped at 75.	UnderpoweredStudy
The main reasons for not reaching the recruitment goal were, first, the lower-than-expected prevalence of ED coupled with tight inclusion criteria, causing a very slow recruitment pace (a planned 2-year study turned out having a 3.5 years recruitment phase); second, the financial constrains caused by the extended recruitment phase; and third, the need to avoid biases caused by changes in the personnel assessing the patients.

Although the use of sham CPAP could allow for a blind design, this option was rejected both to avoid unnecessary discomfort to patients and to avoid neglecting the potential negative implications of using a medical device while sleeping in relation to sexual behavior and/or performance; and, (iv) the Ethics Committee approving the study precluded the inclusion of sleepy patients (ESS score >10) and limited the follow-up time to 3 months, as not providing CPAP treatment to sleepy patients or delaying CPAP treatment initiation beyond 3 months in non-sleepy patients is considered unethical.

A limitation in the fidelity assessment was that the IMR treatment integrity scale (IT-IS) to measure the therapeutic skills of the IMR-instructors or assessment to measure the implementation of IMR at organization level by the General organizational index (GOI-scale) was not applied in this trial.	OutcomeMeasures
As previously mentioned, another limitation was that exposure to IMR was lower than we had hoped.	Population
Furthermore, the waiting time from randomization to the first IMR group session was, on average, 87 days, which might have affected the results; indeed, providing psychosocial treatment when an individual is interested in and motivated to participate in such treatment is important.	StudyDuration
In the present RCT, some of the IMR instructors were case managers for patients in the control group, and therefore, a spill-over effect in the control group was possible.	Intervention
A critical limitation is the high number of incomplete observed data due to a high lost to follow-up rate.	MissingData
Furthermore, a limitation is that nearly one-third of the participants did not complete the self-report instruments a long-term follow-up.	MissingData

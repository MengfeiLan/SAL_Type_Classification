#1	AnnotatorNotes T15	This is a hard sentence for me to understand, but I take it as them saying that - like in the mite matrass trial, #1 in my series) - they were unable to reliably measure a dimension of adherence
T16	ValidityOfMeasurement 24775 24855	The difficulty of capturing all dimensions of physical activity by questionnaire
#2	AnnotatorNotes T16	A difficult one, since one can see activity as an intermediate outcome, but one may also reason (as the authors seem to do) that it has more to do with the intervention. It is because the authors focus primarily on BMD as the only outcome. I do think that technicacally, activity levels are an (intermediate) outcome, since the intervention consists of the provision of information, not training.

#2	AnnotatorNotes T2	tricky, they link this issue (study duration) to stat. significance. Therefore I decide to score it as a Power issue
T8	Setting 33668 33734	the uptake of information could have been better in larger schools
#3	AnnotatorNotes T8	tricky one: what are they saying here? It is not about Imbalance.
T11	UnderpoweredStudy 35818 35936	the trial was not designed to analyze the moderating effects of the school characteristics on the intervention effects
#4	AnnotatorNotes T11	the issue is power, the result is limited generalization.
T17	UnbalancedDropout 36964 36996	the large and unbalanced dropout
#6	AnnotatorNotes T17	they acknowledge both subtypes under this label: High and Unbalance

T21	UnderpoweredStudy 37971 38051	a post-hoc analysis showed a statistical power of 64% and 65% for these outcomes
T22	Generalization 38239 38286	generalization of our findings is hence limited

T5	UnbalancedGroups 31207 31295	a significant interaction between treatment assignment and initial weight loss was found
T11	Intervention 33053 33142	The TAT intervention does not have obvious face validity as a strategy for weight control
#1	AnnotatorNotes T11	This represents special subtype under Intervention, that we do not distinguish.
T12	ConfoundingFactors 33820 33963	Differences in age, stress, depression, and other factors can potentially influence success in managing weight, and may have confounded results
T13	Patient 33973 34029	participants are not blind to their treatment assignment
T14	UnderpoweredStudy 34149 34219	we were not sufficiently powered to account for nesting, or clustering
T15	MultipleTesting 34388 34402	multiple tests
T16	CompositeIntervention 34724 34830	just one, or several, of the individual components of the intervention could be responsible for any effect
T17	UnderpoweredStudy 34999 35025	the effect sizes are small
#2	AnnotatorNotes T17	Small effect size.
T18	FollowUpDuration 33536 33581	a longer follow- up time period may be needed

T0	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 18924 18971	we assessed endpoints only twice 6 months apart
T1	SampleSize 20752 20827	we were unable to enroll our original calculated sample due to slow accrual
T2	SampleSize 21289 21400	an even larger sample size than originally calculated may have been required to detect a significant difference
T3	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 21410 21432	6 month trial duration
T4	VerySpecificPopulation 21560 21659	the majority of our participants were unemployed females with significant neurocognitive impairment
T5	VerySpecificPopulation 21669 21724	all our participants were black Xhosa speaking Africans
T6	Generalization 21731 21773	limits the generalizability of our results
T7	Patient 18532 18614	participants may have become more familiar with the neuropsychological assessments
T8	Patient 18763 18809	cannot completely exclude some practice effect
T9	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 19084 19186	The trajectory of natural disease, placebo, and lithium would be best described in longer term studies
T10	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 19526 19599	we missed social comorbidity improvement explained by trial participation

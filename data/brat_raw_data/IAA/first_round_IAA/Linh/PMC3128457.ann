T6	VerySpecificPopulation 28323 28418	included only a relatively small sample of the CRASH-2 participants with traumatic brain injury
T7	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 28487 28653	The nature of a large pragmatic trial such as the CRASH-2 trial constrained our ability to collect computed tomograms for all the patients with traumatic brain injury
T4	VerySpecificPopulation 24072 24210	The Intracranial Bleeding Study was conducted among patients with traumatic brain injury who also had significant extracranial haemorrhage
T8	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 24216 24313	the effect of tranexamic acid might be different in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury
T5	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 25966 26123	patients allocated to tranexamic acid may have had a more stable circulation and that this may have accounted for the observed reduction in ischaemic lesions

T3	Limitation 28216 28224	However,
T4	Generalization 21044 21150	generalisability of our findings to populations with low-to-moderate risk of vitamin deficiency is unknown
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	They admit this one a a generalizability issue (and I scored it like that), but I think that in fact the issue is a different one: effect-modification of treatment effect by baseline vitamine D levels
T5	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 21285 21394	Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings
T6	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 22293 22457	it was not feasible to undertake biochemical assessment of the supplements or assess serum concentrations in all participants after each and between supplementation
T7	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 22649 22729	a steady-state adequate vitamin D concentration was not reached in some children
#2	AnnotatorNotes T7	I see this as a n issue of between trial-arm contrast, but The category I chose seems closest to that issue.

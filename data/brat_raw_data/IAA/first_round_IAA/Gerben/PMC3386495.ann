#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	Incorrect. The authors weaken their admitted limitation (unblinding of the patients)
T11	ValidityOfMeasurement 30247 30324	measurement of outcome with OHS at 6 months is different from previous trials
#2	AnnotatorNotes T11	Hard to differentiate between Reliability and validity here. The main issue is that they deviated from the most current way of measurement.

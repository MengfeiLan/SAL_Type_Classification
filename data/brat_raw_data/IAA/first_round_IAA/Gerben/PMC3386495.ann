T0	UnderpoweredStudy 28338 28418	was underpowered for the primary outcome (and more so for the subgroup analyses)
T1	RecruitmentLessThanExpected 28637 28679	our failing to achieve our original target
T2	OutcomeAssessor 29257 29275	absence of masking
T3	Patient 29714 29835	self-assessment at 6 months by patients or their carer by postal questionnaire or masked telephone interview was unmasked
T4	AnnotatorNotes T4	Incorrect. The authors weaken their admitted limitation (unblinding of the patients)
T5	ValidityOfMeasurement 30247 30324	measurement of outcome with OHS at 6 months is different from previous trials
T6	AnnotatorNotes T11	Hard to differentiate between Reliability and validity here. The main issue is that they deviated from the most current way of measurement.
T7	OTHER 31345 31434	sampling approach to monitoring in IST-3 was less intense than in many commercial studies
T8	AnnotatorNotes T12	GENERAL DATA QUALITY: This seems to be about the general level of quality control (issues of both validity and precision (reliability)
T9	UnderpoweredStudy 32133 32201	trial was underpowered to reliably detect important subgroup effects

T0	Limitation 35114 35119	There
T1	Limitation 36171 36172	A
T2	Limitation 36316 36330	Unfortunately,
T3	ResponsivenessOfMeasurement 35199 35255	measures were not sensitive enough over this time period
T4	MissingData 36187 36314	the relatively high number of participants who were either unable to tolerate actigraphy or in whom actigraphy equipment failed
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	I now realize that the item 'MissingData' en the item "LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData" is easy to confuse. MissingData we define as followup duration related, whereas LackOfOutcomMeasDatais formulated as a conceptual issue. In this article the issue is missing dta as a result oof device failure or patients being unable to tolerate the measurement, which in my view is,arguably, closer to MissingData than to the other item.
#2	AnnotatorNotes T2	Incorrect. This seems to an elaboration of the previous point made by the authors.
T5	MissingData 36482 36521	actigraphy was often not well tolerated
#3	AnnotatorNotes T5	I voted for Incorrect, but if I had to choose, I choose MissingData

T0	AnnotatorNotes T4	Incorrect. I do not see why this is a limitation. The fact that mortality was low in the placebo group may have contributed to they being able to detect the dangerous effect of the b2-agonist since the background risk being low makes it easier to detect this signal
T1	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 18590 18676	we did not obtain prospective data for cardiovascular comorbidity and causes of deaths
T2	UnderpoweredStudy 18902 18972	the precision of the treatment effect estimates is lower than expected
T3	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 19242 19291	we did not measure details of clinical management
T4	AnnotatorNotes T7	Although this is about standardization of background treatment, not the index treatment, I chose for NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics
T5	Generalization 20021 20081	conclusions from our study can relate only to the dose given
T6	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 20087 20171	mechanisms underlying the increased mortality in the salbutamol group remain unclear

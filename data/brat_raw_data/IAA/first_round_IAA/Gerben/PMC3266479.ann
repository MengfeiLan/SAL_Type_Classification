T4	Limitation 18364 18426	mortality in the placebo group was much lower than anticipated
#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	Incorrect. I do not see why this is a limitation. The fact that mortality was low in the placebo group may have contributed to they being able to detect the dangerous effect of the b2-agonist since the background risk being low makes it easier to detect this signal
T5	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 18590 18676	we did not obtain prospective data for cardiovascular comorbidity and causes of deaths
T6	UnderpoweredStudy 18902 18972	the precision of the treatment effect estimates is lower than expected
T7	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 19242 19291	we did not measure details of clinical management
#2	AnnotatorNotes T7	Although this is about standardization of background treatment, not the index treatment, I chose for NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics

T0	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 22245 22319	clinical effect and the practical impact of treatment may be overestimated
T1	UnderpoweredStudy 22938 22955	small sample size
T2	UnderpoweredStudy 23094 23111	small sample size
T3	PoorRandomizationMethods 24574 24624	deviation from a better balance between study arms
T4	PoorRandomizationMethods 24790 24852	randomization ratio was 1:1:1:1 with blocks of four per center
T5	AnnotatorNotes T12	I believe that this is the cause of the consequence mentioned in the following sentence. A bit hard to grasp until you realize that this is a 4-arm RCTT
T6	Patient 24910 24943	premature unblinding of a patient
T7	AnnotatorNotes T14	This is confusing to me. The 1:1:1:1 randomization in a 4-armed group with perfect placebos and good concealment is not necessarily a problem. They speak about patient unblinding, but then of consequences at the level of the care provider.
T8	Patient 25085 25121	a patient was accidentally unblinded
T9	PoorRandomizationMethods 25307 25374	randomization ratio with blocks of eight would have been preferable
T10	MissingData 26119 26163	resulting data are too little to be analyzed
T11	AnnotatorNotes T17	Difficult one. I also thought of ticking OutcomeMeasures, but felt that they added this measure, only too late so that too many patients had it missing
T12	AnnotatorNotes T7	Incorrect

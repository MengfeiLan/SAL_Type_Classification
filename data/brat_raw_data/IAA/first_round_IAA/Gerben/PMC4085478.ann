T12	PoorRandomizationMethods 24790 24852	randomization ratio was 1:1:1:1 with blocks of four per center
#1	AnnotatorNotes T12	I believe that this is the cause of the consequence mentioned in the following sentence. A bit hard to grasp until you realize that this is a 4-arm RCTT
T13	Limitation 24786 24789	The
T14	Patient 24910 24943	premature unblinding of a patient
#2	AnnotatorNotes T14	This is confusing to me. The 1:1:1:1 randomization in a 4-armed group with perfect placebos and good concealment is not necessarily a problem. They speak about patient unblinding, but then of consequences at the level of the care provider.
T15	Patient 25085 25121	a patient was accidentally unblinded
T16	PoorRandomizationMethods 25307 25374	randomization ratio with blocks of eight would have been preferable
T17	MissingData 26119 26163	resulting data are too little to be analyzed
#3	AnnotatorNotes T17	Difficult one. I also thought of ticking OutcomeMeasures, but felt that they added this measure, only too late so that too many patients had it missing

T0	UnderpoweredStudy 33102 33142	study was not powered for these analyses

T5	DiagnosticCriteria 37871 37911	We did not have many adults in our study
T6	Generalization 38028 38103	caution the extension of our results to, for example, morbidly obese adults
T7	UnderpoweredStudy 38241 38305	subgroup analyses involved small numbers; thus power was limited
T8	OTHER 38310 38364	some significant results could have resulted by chance

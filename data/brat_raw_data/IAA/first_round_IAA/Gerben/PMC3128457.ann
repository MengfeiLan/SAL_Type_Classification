T4	UnderpoweredStudy 1860 1989	neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful effects of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury can be excluded
T5	Generalization 24220 24313	effect of tranexamic acid might be different in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury
#1	AnnotatorNotes T5	I was tempted to also click Population (VerySpecificPopulation), but decided not to complicate the matter.
T6	UnderpoweredStudy 25576 25646	observed difference between the groups may have arisen by chance alone
#2	AnnotatorNotes T6	The study was underpowered to address this effect in a subgroup, which is subtly different from the study was underpowered in general (for the main effect)
T7	Limitation 25491 25498	However
T8	UnbalancedGroups 25966 26042	patients allocated to tranexamic acid may have had a more stable circulation
#3	AnnotatorNotes T8	I was tempted to call this limitation 'No Limitation', since the claim is quite unlikely given proper randomization, but I decided to accept that they mention it as a limitation and say nothing about the likelihood of it being present, except using the modifier "may
T9	UnderpoweredStudy 28313 28418	our study included only a relatively small sample of the CRASH-2 participants with traumatic brain injury
#4	AnnotatorNotes T9	The authors see this as a limitation of precision (i.e. 95%CI width) and I went with that. Nevertheless, this issue may also be seen, methodologically, as relating to Population and Generalization
T10	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 28491 28653	nature of a large pragmatic trial such as the CRASH-2 trial constrained our ability to collect computed tomograms for all the patients with traumatic brain injury

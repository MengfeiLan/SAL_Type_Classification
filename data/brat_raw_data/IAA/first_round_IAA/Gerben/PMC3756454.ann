T0	DiagnosticCriteria 23189 23234	relatively low plasma concentrations of TNF-α
T1	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 23949 24133	confounding factors such as those related to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variation between subjects and the effects of concurrent medical therapy are challenging to standardise
T2	AnnotatorNotes T4	The authors collate the issue of confounding with that of (unbalanced?) concomitant treatments. I chose to see this a an issue of not standardizing treatment regimes primalrily
T3	DiagnosticCriteria 24330 24441	more rapid treatment (within the first 24 h) and higher doses of etanercept may have produced different results
T4	AnnotatorNotes T5	The authors collate the population issue with the dosing issue in one sentence, so I had to make a choice

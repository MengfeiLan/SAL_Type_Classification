T8	UnderpoweredStudy 22934 23041	The small sample size of the current trial resulted in a reduced statistical power for secondary end points
T9	Patient 25085 25139	a patient was accidentally unblinded by a study nurse.

T11	UnbalancedGroups 24550 24624	this explains a certain deviation from a better balance between study arms
T12	SampleSize 23085 23184	With our small sample size, success rate estimates of qualitative variables have a high variability

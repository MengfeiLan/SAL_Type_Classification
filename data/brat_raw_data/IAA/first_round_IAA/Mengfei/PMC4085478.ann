T0	UnderpoweredStudy 22934 23041	The small sample size of the current trial resulted in a reduced statistical power for secondary end points
T1	Patient 25085 25139	a patient was accidentally unblinded by a study nurse.
T2	Patient 24870 24943	a potential limited bias in case of the premature unblinding of a patient
T3	UnbalancedGroups 24550 24624	this explains a certain deviation from a better balance between study arms
T4	SampleSize 23085 23184	With our small sample size, success rate estimates of qualitative variables have a high variability
T5	SuboptimalStatisticalAnalysis 22241 22354	The clinical effect and the practical impact of treatment may be overestimated with the use of numerical changes,
T6	PoorRandomizationMethods 25305 25411	A randomization ratio with blocks of eight would have been preferable, but it was financially not feasible
T7	Control 26018 26081	it was not established and was included into the running study.

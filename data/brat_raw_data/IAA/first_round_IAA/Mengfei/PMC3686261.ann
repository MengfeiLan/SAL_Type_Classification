T0	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 26385 26465	Differences in patient discontinuations over time represent a further limitation
T1	StatisticalAnalysis 25680 25737	The joints analysed for JE and JSN also offer limitations
T2	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 25267 25404	they remain surrogate measures that rely on visual representation and interpretation of joint damage and can be subject to error and bias
T3	CompositeIntervention 25419 25606	as JSN is not a direct measure of cartilage damage, surrounding tissues may also be damaged, and the JSN measurement technique cannot determine the relative contributions of these tissues
T4	OTHER 26633 26789	the post-hoc nature of these analyses should be considered to be hypothesis generating and require confirmation in other databases of patients with early RA

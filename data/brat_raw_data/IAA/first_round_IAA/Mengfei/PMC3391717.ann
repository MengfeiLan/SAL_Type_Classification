T10	InappropriateFollowUpDuration 15987 16073	did not call patients back for study visits for detailed assessment of quality of life
T12	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 18088 18200	time to treatment with magnesium in MASH 2 might not have been short enough to ameliorate acute ischaemic injury
T13	CompositeIntervention 17068 17204	An effect of magnesium treatment on cognitive symptoms—which are common after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage—might have been missed
T14	Control 16452 16594	we did not include other baseline measurements such as amount of blood in CT scan or systemic illness, nor did we do close on-site monitoring.
T15	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 16608 16679	we do not have complete information about adherence to study medication
T16	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 16684 16747	did not require magnesium concentration to be routinely checked
T17	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 16815 16928	cannot exclude the possibility of unmasking of investigators by checking patients' serum magnesium concentrations
T18	OutcomeMeasures 17264 17429	3 months after haemorrhage, which is a usual period for outcome assessment in stroke studies, and although a benefit might be detected later, we consider it unlikely
T11	OutcomeMeasures 16226 16269	poor outcome as our primary outcome measure

T3	Control 38561 38603	the trial allocation was of necessity open

T5	CompositeIntervention 41935 42138	This scenario seems unlikely since substantial CD4 variability and complexity around toxicity test interpretation mean that simple rules for acting on routine test results are unlikely ever to be optimum

T0	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 43663 43782	4% of randomised participants did not have an endpoint blood pressure recorded and were excluded from endpoint analyses
T1	Blinding 42618 42793	unblinded blood pressures in the clinic reported by general practitioners (albeit using a standardised protocol and automated monitors) may have resulted in an element of bias
T2	CompositeIntervention 42186 42293	this resulted in almost inevitable cross contamination of more intensive management in the usual care group
T3	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 44161 44342	The general practitioners were reluctant to try to meet the more aggressive guideline targets for blood pressure reduction and in almost 15% of cases opted for a more lenient target
T4	Blinding 40214 40292	with no blinding of treatment pathways or blood pressure measurements possible

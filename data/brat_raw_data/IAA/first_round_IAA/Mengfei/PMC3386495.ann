T0	UnderpoweredStudy 28262 28330	IST-3 recruited only half the number of patients originally intended
T1	CompositeIntervention 28420 28598	The many changes in the regulatory environment over the course of the trial delayed the approval of the trial in many centres and precluded the participation of several countries
T2	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 29888 29947	self-reported outcome by patients is necessarily subjective
T3	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 29714 29877	self-assessment at 6 months by patients or their carer by postal questionnaire or masked telephone interview was unmasked and so could be subject to reporting bias
T4	OTHER 29253 29339	The absence of masking is most relevant for the assessment of the events within 7 days
T5	SampleSize 31341 31434	the sampling approach to monitoring in IST-3 was less intense than in many commercial studies
T6	UnderpoweredStudy 32143 32201	underpowered to reliably detect important subgroup effects

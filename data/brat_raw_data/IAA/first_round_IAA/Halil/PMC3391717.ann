T10	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 15939 16073	we collected key baseline and outcome data, but did not call patients back for study visits for detailed assessment of quality of life
T11	OutcomeMeasures 16217 16269	we chose poor outcome as our primary outcome measure
T12	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 16608 16679	we do not have complete information about adherence to study medication

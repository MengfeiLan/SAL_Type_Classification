T0	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 15939 16073	we collected key baseline and outcome data, but did not call patients back for study visits for detailed assessment of quality of life
T1	OutcomeMeasures 16217 16269	we chose poor outcome as our primary outcome measure
T2	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 16608 16679	we do not have complete information about adherence to study medication
T3	LackOfOutcomeMeasurementData 16452 16553	we did not include other baseline measurements such as amount of blood in CT scan or systemic illness
T4	ReliabilityOfMeasurement 16555 16593	nor did we do close on-site monitoring
T5	Blinding 16812 16928	We cannot exclude the possibility of unmasking of investigators by checking patients' serum magnesium concentrations
T6	ResponsivenessOfMeasurement 17068 17233	An effect of magnesium treatment on cognitive symptoms—which are common after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage—might have been missed by the modified Rankin Scale
T7	InappropriateFollowUpDuration 17371 17404	a benefit might be detected later
T8	Intervention 18088 18200	time to treatment with magnesium in MASH 2 might not have been short enough to ameliorate acute ischaemic injury

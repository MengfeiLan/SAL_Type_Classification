T0	CompositeIntervention 18763 18809	cannot completely exclude some practice effect
T1	VerySpecificPopulation 21669 21724	all our participants were black Xhosa speaking Africans
T2	SampleSize 21289 21365	an even larger sample size than originally calculated may have been required
T3	CompositeIntervention 18532 18643	participants may have become more familiar with the neuropsychological assessments leading to a practice effect
T4	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 18924 18965	we assessed endpoints only twice 6 months
T5	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 19084 19186	The trajectory of natural disease, placebo, and lithium would be best described in longer term studies
T6	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 19526 19566	we missed social comorbidity improvement
T7	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 20752 20807	we were unable to enroll our original calculated sample
T8	CompositeIntervention 21410 21515	6 month trial duration could not exclude a beneficial effect of lithium on long-term functional worsening
T9	Population 21524 21616	we cannot exclude selection bias as the majority of our participants were unemployed females
T10	Generalization 21725 21758	which limits the generalizability

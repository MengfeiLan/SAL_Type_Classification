T0	HighLossToFollowUp 23967 24030	some differential loss to follow-up in the intensive target arm
T1	MissingData 23824 23900	Blood pressure at 12 months was not available for 28% of patients randomised
T2	SampleSize 24732 24818	Only 4% of patients on general practice stroke/TIA registers participated in the trial
T3	VerySpecificPopulation 25018 25068	over-represented people with a history of TIA only
T4	HighLossToFollowUp 28820 28879	Greater reluctance to lower blood pressure when near target
T5	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 28881 29050	higher attribution of symptoms to blood pressure treatment (table 2) despite an absence of objective evidence of increased symptoms (table 4) in the intensive target arm
T6	HighLossToFollowUp 29056 29133	greater reluctance of patients to increase treatment hint at the difficulties
T7	HighLossToFollowUp 30615 30724	reluctance on the part of both clinicians and patients to instigate all increases in blood pressure treatment
T8	HighLossToFollowUp 23917 23960	a high number of withdrawals from the study
T9	VerySpecificPopulation 25168 25261	the trial population was more representative of people with prevalent cerebrovascular disease
T10	Blinding 25424 25460	The outcome measure was not blinded,
T11	ActivePlacebo 25615 25670	The standard target arm in PAST-BP was actively managed
T12	Control 26209 26234	We used an active control
T13	HighLossToFollowUp 29261 29362	the significantly higher proportion of participants that withdrew from the trial in the intensive arm
T14	Control 30384 30493	the protocol did not stipulate a reduction in blood pressure treatment if the blood pressure was below target
T15	ActivePlacebo 30498 30585	the control arm was actively managed to achieve a target blood pressure below 140 mm Hg
T16	Control 30749 30821	the achieved difference in blood pressure between the two arms was small
T17	SampleSize 24238 24272	we did not achieve our sample size

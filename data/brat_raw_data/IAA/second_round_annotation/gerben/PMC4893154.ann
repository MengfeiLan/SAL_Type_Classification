T0	UnderpoweredStudy 25965 26049	our sample size only had 7% post hoc power to detect a difference between the groups
T1	UnderpoweredStudy 26051 26143	VINDICATE was therefore underpowered to detect a clinically relevant change in walk distance
T2	AnnotatorNotes T4	this is but an elaboration of the prevous sentences on the use of the 6MWD test
T3	UnderpoweredStudy 26792 26805	lack of power
T4	Unicentric 28702 28744	VINDICATE was performed at a single center
T5	VerySpecificPopulation 28971 29089	We did not examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients with chronic HF and preserved ejection fraction
T6	AnnotatorNotes T10	Here choosing Generalizability would be defensible too. We stipulate in our criteria population they DID study, but here they say who did did NOT study. That can (also)  be seen as an issue of generalizability

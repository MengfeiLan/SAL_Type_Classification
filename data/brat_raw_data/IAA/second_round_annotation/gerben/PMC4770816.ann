T13	HighLossToFollowUp 23824 23900	Blood pressure at 12 months was not available for 28% of patients randomised
T14	HighLossToFollowUp 23917 23945	a high number of withdrawals
T15	UnbalancedDropout 23967 24030	some differential loss to follow-up in the intensive target arm
T16	SampleSize 24238 24272	we did not achieve our sample size
T17	Generalization 24732 24818	Only 4% of patients on general practice stroke/TIA registers participated in the trial
#1	AnnotatorNotes T17	I realize that my choice involves an inference. But this choice seemed better that an item under Population
T18	Generalization 24820 25069	Participants had a low prevalence of disability for a prevalent cerebrovascular disease population, were younger than typical patients in primary care with a history of cerebrovascular disease, and over-represented people with a history of TIA only.
#2	AnnotatorNotes T18	my choice involves a bit of inference, but seems more defensible than Population (this may be confusing)
T19	Generalization 25100 25261	the more intensive target would have been even harder to achieve if the trial population was more representative of people with prevalent cerebrovascular disease
T20	StudyTeam 25424 25459	The outcome measure was not blinded
T21	ActivePlacebo 25791 25947	If we had used a more passive management strategy in the comparison group, we may have achieved a greater separation in systolic blood pressure between arms
T22	ActivePlacebo 26209 26234	We used an active control
T23	ActivePlacebo 25615 25670	The standard target arm in PAST-BP was actively managed
#3	AnnotatorNotes T11	I see no acknowledgment of a limitation of the study. I read this as a warning to those who want to implement the trial's findngs
T24	UnbalancedDropout 29261 29362	the significantly higher proportion of participants that withdrew from the trial in the intensive arm
T25	Intervention 30384 30493	the protocol did not stipulate a reduction in blood pressure treatment if the blood pressure was below target
T26	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 30615 30747	reluctance on the part of both clinicians and patients to instigate all increases in blood pressure treatment in the intensive group

T0	SampleSize 20752 20807	we were unable to enroll our original calculated sample
T1	SampleSize 21289 21400	an even larger sample size than originally calculated may have been required to detect a significant difference
T2	Population 21524 21659	we cannot exclude selection bias as the majority of our participants were unemployed females with significant neurocognitive impairment
T3	AnnotatorNotes T13	I chose Population, although the core issue is generalization (but that is inference, I guess)
T4	Generalization 21669 21724	all our participants were black Xhosa speaking Africans
T5	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 21410 21432	6 month trial duration

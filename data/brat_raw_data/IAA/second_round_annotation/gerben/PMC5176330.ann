T0	Generalization 21097 21171	the findings may not be applicable to the wider population including women
T1	MissingData 21335 21394	We were able to obtain results from only 3,318 participants
T2	OutcomeMeasures 21680 21737	Our analysis was performed on samples stored for 20 years
T3	PrecisionOfMeasurement 21743 21913	it is possible we underestimated the association between troponin and coronary heart disease events because of interference from the formation of fibrin microparticulates
T4	Generalization 22419 22499	it will be more challenging to monitor changes accurately in individual patients
T5	Generalization 22501 22651	Changes in troponin concentration of 2 ng/l after initiation of statin therapy may be masked by other aspects of biological or analytical variability.

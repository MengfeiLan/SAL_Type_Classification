T0	Generalization 37307 37353	tool  only applies to patients with chest pain
T1	Generalization 37364 37488	the decision aid cannot be used in patients with potential acute coronary syndrome who present with non-chest pain syndromes
T2	OutcomeMeasures 37542 37684	more accurate methods to estimate patient risk, such as those incorporating high sensitivity troponin C assays, are likely to become available
T3	AnnotatorNotes T10	Strictly, this does not pertain to an OUTCOME (dependent variable), but to a diagnostic indicator (predictive variable, independent variable). That would nessitate an additional OTHER category
T4	Randomization 38522 38556	We randomized at the patient level
T5	AnnotatorNotes T11	to call this 'poor' is too extreme, so I kept it more general
T6	MissingData 39109 39180	we were unable to contact 70 (8%) for assessment of a secondary outcome
T7	SampleSize 39468 39534	We were unable to obtain video recordings in 40% of the encounters
T8	UnderpoweredStudy 39925 39969	greater power and precision would be optimal

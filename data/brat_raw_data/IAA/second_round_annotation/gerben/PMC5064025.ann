T5	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 24485 24525	nor did it quantify plaque lipid content
T6	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 24366 24436	This study did not evaluate atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation
T7	Population 24819 24893	no attempt was made to select subjects on the basis of inflammatory status
T8	Intervention 25032 25169	we cannot exclude the possibility that the dose of canakinumab was not high enough to generate a maximal effect on atherosclerotic burden
T9	SampleSize 25382 25469	this small study cannot thoroughly or systematically evaluate the safety of canakinumab
T10	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 24536 24675	MRI scans provide highly reproducible measures of plaque structure and vessel function, they offer no direct measure of plaque inflammation

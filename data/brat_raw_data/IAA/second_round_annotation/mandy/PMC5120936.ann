T0	Population 18532 18643	participants may have become more familiar with the neuropsychological assessments leading to a practice effect
T1	OTHER 18763 18809	cannot completely exclude some practice effect
T2	MissingData 19505 19599	it is plausible that we missed social comorbidity improvement explained by trial participation
T3	SampleSize 20760 20827	unable to enroll our original calculated sample due to slow accrual
T4	UnderpoweredStudy 21289 21400	an even larger sample size than originally calculated may have been required to detect a significant difference
T5	Population 21527 21659	cannot exclude selection bias as the majority of our participants were unemployed females with significant neurocognitive impairment
T6	VerySpecificPopulation 21669 21724	all our participants were black Xhosa speaking Africans
T7	Generalization 21731 21773	limits the generalizability of our results
T8	Intervention 18924 18971	we assessed endpoints only twice 6 months apart
T9	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 19084 19186	The trajectory of natural disease, placebo, and lithium would be best described in longer term studies
T10	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 21410 21515	6 month trial duration could not exclude a beneficial effect of lithium on long-term functional worsening

T10	Population 18532 18643	participants may have become more familiar with the neuropsychological assessments leading to a practice effect
T11	OTHER 18763 18809	cannot completely exclude some practice effect
T12	MissingData 19505 19599	it is plausible that we missed social comorbidity improvement explained by trial participation
T13	SampleSize 20760 20827	unable to enroll our original calculated sample due to slow accrual
T14	UnderpoweredStudy 21289 21400	an even larger sample size than originally calculated may have been required to detect a significant difference
T17	Population 21527 21659	cannot exclude selection bias as the majority of our participants were unemployed females with significant neurocognitive impairment
T18	VerySpecificPopulation 21669 21724	all our participants were black Xhosa speaking Africans
T19	Generalization 21731 21773	limits the generalizability of our results
T20	Intervention 18924 18971	we assessed endpoints only twice 6 months apart
T21	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 19084 19186	The trajectory of natural disease, placebo, and lithium would be best described in longer term studies
T15	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 21410 21515	6 month trial duration could not exclude a beneficial effect of lithium on long-term functional worsening

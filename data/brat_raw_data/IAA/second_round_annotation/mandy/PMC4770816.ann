T0	HighLossToFollowUp 23919 23945	high number of withdrawals
T1	UnbalancedDropout 23967 24030	some differential loss to follow-up in the intensive target arm
T2	SampleSize 24241 24272	did not achieve our sample size
T3	Population 24732 24818	Only 4% of patients on general practice stroke/TIA registers participated in the trial
T4	VerySpecificPopulation 24925 25068	younger than typical patients in primary care with a history of cerebrovascular disease, and over-represented people with a history of TIA only
T5	Population 25100 25164	the more intensive target would have been even harder to achieve
T6	Blinding 25448 25459	not blinded
T7	Blinding 25465 25532	a nurse not directly involved in the participant’s care obtained it
T8	UnbalancedDropout 29279 29362	higher proportion of participants that withdrew from the trial in the intensive arm
T9	MissingData 23824 23900	Blood pressure at 12 months was not available for 28% of patients randomised
T10	CareAsUsualControlGroup 25767 25790	receiving “usual care.”
T11	ActivePlacebo 26209 26234	We used an active control
T12	Population 29056 29108	greater reluctance of patients to increase treatment
T13	MissingData 30384 30493	the protocol did not stipulate a reduction in blood pressure treatment if the blood pressure was below target
T14	ActivePlacebo 30498 30585	the control arm was actively managed to achieve a target blood pressure below 140 mm Hg

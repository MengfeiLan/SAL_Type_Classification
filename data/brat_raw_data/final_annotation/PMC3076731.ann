T8	Limitation 29628 29636	Although
T9	SampleSize 27986 28134	The number of girls who had completed the study and achieved final height at the time of analysis (n=82) fell short of the target sample size of 100
T10	SampleSize 28136 28244	Even when the remaining girls complete the study, the number evaluable at final height will still only be 92
T11	SampleSize 28486 28531	the failure to achieve the target sample size
T12	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 28633 28728	the break in production of oxandrolone 2.5 mg tablets twice led to deviations from the protocol
T13	ExperimentalPhaseDuration 28848 28890	the early termination of the treatment arm
#1	AnnotatorNotes T13	EarlyTermination
T14	UnderpoweredStudy 28903 28963	the results may underestimate the true effect of oxandrolone
T15	SampleSize 29376 29507	the group sizes of those who were randomised twice and attained final height were too small to allow further breakdown by karyotype
T16	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 29509 29581	A measure of bone mineral density was not included in the study protocol
T17	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 29688 29777	the necessary scanning equipment was not routinely available at all participating centres

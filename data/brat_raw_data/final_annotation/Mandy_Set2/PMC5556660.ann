T0	Population 15882 15941	difficulties in attracting eligible subjects for enrollment
T1	Population 15953 16067	patients were already transferred to stenting when visiting the site and therefore were reluctant to be randomized
T2	SampleSize 16134 16163	the very slow enrollment rate
T3	SampleSize 16387 16430	only 28.7% of the total cohort was enrolled
T4	UnderpoweredStudy 16438 16485	sufficient statistical power was never achieved
T5	Intervention 20021 20081	Only six patients in the stent group had two lesions treated
T6	Population 20383 20449	nearly one third of the patients had diabetes mellitus at baseline
T7	SampleSize 21427 21455	the small number of patients
T8	Population 21494 21543	enrolled at least some patients with reduced risk
T9	DiagnosticCriteria 21591 21658	some patients did not meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria
T10	DiagnosticCriteria 21660 21722	The inclusion of patients not meeting all eligibility criteria
T11	Population 22493 22507	selection bias
T12	HighLossToFollowUp 22751 22783	the follow-up compliance was low
T13	SampleSize 22832 22882	slow recruitment with only a few patients per site
T14	VerySpecificPopulation 19185 19254	the relatively mild form of hypertension at baseline in most patients
T15	StudyDesign 22388 22466	it is questionable whether the study hypothesis using the eGFR was appropriate
T16	VerySpecificPopulation 22512 22623	severely diseased patients who were transferred for renal artery stenting might not have been enrolled in RADAR

T0	DiagnosticCriteria 25200 25284	The patient group were broadly defined, comprising a range of respiratory infections
T1	Randomization 25564 25693	Participants in the non-randomised group (being prescribed antibiotics immediately) had slightly more severe symptoms at baseline
T2	UnderpoweredStudy 25859 25965	The study was not powered to detect a range of antibiotic use that was less than 20% (between 15% and 35%)
T3	SampleSize 26207 26227	Recruitment was slow
T4	Generalization 26545 26574	questions of generalisability
T5	UnderpoweredStudy 27569 27621	was not specifically powered to assess complications
T6	UnderpoweredStudy 27878 27935	the trial was not formally powered to detect interactions
T7	OutcomeMeasures 28317 28382	no interactions were postulated on theoretical grounds in advance
T8	UnderpoweredStudy 28397 28467	the spread of the estimates of interactions was consistent with chance
T9	MissingData 28469 28538	It was not possible for all outcomes to be included in the follow-ups
T10	DiagnosticCriteria 25295 25322	the heterogenous population
T11	UnderpoweredStudy 28581 28694	less power for outcomes that were only measured in the main diary, such as belief in antibiotics and satisfaction

T0	FollowUpDuration 23464 23498	confirmation of long-term benefits
T1	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 23503 23574	assessment of the cost effectiveness of the intervention needs to occur
T2	PrecisionOfMeasurement 24414 24479	Variation in the types of activity captured by simple self-report
T3	AnnotatorNotes T15	This is a hard sentence for me to understand, but I take it as them saying that - like in the mite matrass trial, #1 in my series) - they were unable to reliably measure a dimension of adherence
T4	ValidityOfMeasurement 24775 24855	The difficulty of capturing all dimensions of physical activity by questionnaire
T5	AnnotatorNotes T16	A difficult one, since one can see activity as an intermediate outcome, but one may also reason (as the authors seem to do) that it has more to do with the intervention. It is because the authors focus primarily on BMD as the only outcome. I do think that technicacally, activity levels are an (intermediate) outcome, since the intervention consists of the provision of information, not training.
T6	UnderpoweredStudy 25480 25553	the study had insufficient power to detect a meaningful difference in BMD
T7	VerySpecificPopulation 26257 26283	selection bias is possible
T8	VerySpecificPopulation 26314 26453	The proportion of current smokers in the sample is lower than the Tasmanian prevalence of daily smoking in females aged 25â€“44 years in 1998
T9	AnnotatorNotes T19	Note that my assignment is an interpretation. Strictly by what they say, this is not a limitation, just an assertion of fact.
T10	FollowUpDuration 28054 28250	it is not possible to determine whether the effect of calcium on BMD over the two years of the study is indicative of long-term gain in steady-state bone mass or is due to the remodeling transient
T11	FollowUpDuration 28252 28283	Longer-term follow-up is needed
T12	FollowUpDuration 28368 28389	Even longer follow-up
T13	CompositeIntervention 28486 28557	We chose not to have an intervention group receiving BMD feedback alone
T14	CompositeIntervention 28913 29025	this limits the ability to state categorically which effects were due to the BMD feedback and which the leaflet,

T0	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 16658 16736	additional data on the clinical relevance of resistance with DAAs are required
T1	AnnotatorNotes T10	Unsure if they refer to outcome measures or other data
T2	Population 18262 18372	the importance of the combination of these mutations is not well defined and needs to be investigated further.
T3	AnnotatorNotes T11	another vague limitation that the study did not cover all aspects
T4	SampleSize 18504 18527	the limited sample size
T5	SampleSize 18940 18964	sample size limitations.

T7	UnbalancedGroups 19863 19893	discrepancies in baseline data
T8	UnbalancedGroups 19967 20030	baseline differences in HCV G4 subtype between treatment groups
T9	MissingData 20047 20125	sequencing and virologic response data could not be obtained for some patients
T10	AnnotatorNotes T19	they connect thios issue to power (I remained close to the text, but I think that is controversial)
T11	Population 18529 18585	the lack of consistency of the mutations across patients
T12	UnderpoweredStudy 19748 19766	insufficient power

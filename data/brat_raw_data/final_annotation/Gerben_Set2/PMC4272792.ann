T0	OutcomeMeasures 32595 32667	We covered screen time in classes only during the first year of the tria
T1	AnnotatorNotes T2	tricky, they link this issue (study duration) to stat. significance. Therefore I decide to score it as a Power issue
T2	Setting 33668 33734	the uptake of information could have been better in larger schools
T3	AnnotatorNotes T8	tricky one: what are they saying here? It is not about Imbalance.
T4	UnderpoweredStudy 35818 35936	the trial was not designed to analyze the moderating effects of the school characteristics on the intervention effects
T5	AnnotatorNotes T11	the issue is power, the result is limited generalization.
T6	UnbalancedDropout 36964 36996	the large and unbalanced dropout
T7	AnnotatorNotes T17	they acknowledge both subtypes under this label: High and Unbalance
T8	MissingData 37322 37373	The assessment of physical activity in a sub-sample
T9	StudyTeam 37486 37553	we cannot rule out that they observed elements of the interventions
T10	MissingData 37596 37660	We could only assess the use of the walking trail in two schools
T11	UnderpoweredStudy 37971 38051	a post-hoc analysis showed a statistical power of 64% and 65% for these outcomes
T12	Generalization 38239 38286	generalization of our findings is hence limited

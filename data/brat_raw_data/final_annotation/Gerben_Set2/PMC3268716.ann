T0	SampleSize 25339 25360	the small sample size
T1	CompositeIntervention 25368 25431	the possible overlapping effects of the ICS and LABA components
T2	StudyDesign 25476 25536	it was not possible to make a formal sample size calculation
T3	AnnotatorNotes T6	PRE-TRIAL (OR PLANNING PHASE) PROCEDURE: TAKEN LITERALLY, THIS IS A LIMITATION ON PRE-TRIAL (OR PLANNING PHASE) PROCEDURE. IMPLIED IS A SAMPLE SIZE OR POWER PROBLEM, BUT WE SAID WE WILL BE LITERAL NOT IMPLIED
T4	SampleSize 25555 25594	the reduced number of enrolled patients

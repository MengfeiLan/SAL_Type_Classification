T0	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 22406 22538	Myoglobin values peak within hours after a myocardial lesion and therefore were not detected at the time points of 4 hours and POD1.
T1	AnnotatorNotes T11	What is missing is an additional relevant time point for measurement
T2	Intervention 23159 23209	Application of volatile anesthetics during surgery
T3	AnnotatorNotes T12	I have no idea what is acknowledged here
T4	RelevantOutcomeExcluded 23461 23490	only biomarkers were analyzed
T5	UnderpoweredStudy 23647 23698	Such trials would require large numbers of patients
T6	AnnotatorNotes T15	This is )perhaps) indirectly acknowledging that this study itself lacks power
T7	ActivePlacebo 24806 24876	the controlled substance propofol also has protective characteristics.
T8	Intervention 25602 25649	the postconditioning phase was relatively short
T9	Intervention 25712 25797	the applied dose of sevoflurane reflecting an age-adjusted 0.5 MAC was relatively low
T10	StatisticalAnalysis 26174 26223	we did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis
T11	Intervention 26345 26455	chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are firmly linked with stratospheric ozone depletion and global atmospheric warming
T12	AnnotatorNotes T20	This is a climate change limitation, not included in our set

T10	UnderpoweredStudy 33610 33642	the study was still underpowered
T11	UnderpoweredStudy 33644 33724	The subgroup analysis is therefore confronted with an even poorer lack of power.
T12	UnderpoweredStudy 33867 33940	These trends nevertheless can be considered only as hypothesis-generating

T13	UnderpoweredStudy 34223 34267	SAH group experienced very few complications

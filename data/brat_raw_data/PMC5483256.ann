T0	UnderpoweredStudy 26876 26931	we did not power the study for these secondary outcomes
T1	ValidityOfMeasurement 27549 27643	a more direct measure of fitness, such as cycle ergometry to determine VO2 max, is recommended
T2	OutcomeMeasures 27727 27798	alternative tools for objectively measuring PA among PwMS are warranted
T3	MissingData 27945 27973	we did not record heart rate
T4	PrecisionOfMeasurement 21902 21987	It is also possible that the arm worn accelerometer did not capture the changes in PA

T6	VerySpecificPopulation 26314 26453	The proportion of current smokers in the sample is lower than the Tasmanian prevalence of daily smoking in females aged 25–44 years in 1998
T7	FollowUpDuration 28054 28250	it is not possible to determine whether the effect of calcium on BMD over the two years of the study is indicative of long-term gain in steady-state bone mass or is due to the remodeling transient
T8	FollowUpDuration 28252 28283	Longer-term follow-up is needed

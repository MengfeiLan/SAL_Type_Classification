T0	Blinding 40192 40293	an open label design (with no blinding of treatment pathways or blood pressure measurements possible)
T1	Setting 40392 40447	relied on the mainstream healthcare system in Australia
T2	Intervention 42221 42293	cross contamination of more intensive management in the usual care group
T3	StudyTeam 42618 42691	unblinded blood pressures in the clinic reported by general practitioners
T4	MissingData 43663 43741	4% of randomised participants did not have an endpoint blood pressure recorded
T5	NonstandardTreatmentCharacteristics 44161 44342	The general practitioners were reluctant to try to meet the more aggressive guideline targets for blood pressure reduction and in almost 15% of cases opted for a more lenient target
T6	PrecisionOfMeasurement 43202 43328	Whether these data would be reproduced if we had studied 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure or home blood pressure measurements

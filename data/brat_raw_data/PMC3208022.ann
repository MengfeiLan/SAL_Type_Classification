T0	UnderpoweredStudy 36364 36442	It was powered only to compare individual programmes with the comparator group
T1	PrecisionOfMeasurement 36562 36598	we asked participants to self report
T2	PrecisionOfMeasurement 36854 36886	some measurement error may exist
T3	PrecisionOfMeasurement 36888 37000	The self reported physical activity seems high and, as reported previously,32 33 is likely to be an overestimate
T4	MissingData 37235 37344	we do not have data on health outcomes or on the previous strategies for weight loss used by the participants
T5	VerySpecificPopulation 37393 37456	These are likely to be people who were most motivated to change
T6	PrecisionOfMeasurement 37719 37753	they may be subject to some errors
T7	MissingData 37846 37881	we have not tried to determine cost
T8	ConfoundingFactors 38063 38180	We could not unpick the elements associated with greater weight loss in people who attended the commercial programmes

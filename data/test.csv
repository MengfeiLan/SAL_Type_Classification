PMC116603,18152,[8] A further possible explanation could be that the patients recruited on average suffered relatively mild disease (reflected by their low baseline asthma symptom scores); they were therefore sufficiently well controlled on existing treatment for little scope to remain for clinical improvement (Table 2).,True,['patients recruited on average suffered relatively mild disease'],['VerySpecificPopulation'],['Population']

PMC116603,18158,Allergen avoidance measures are likely to be of most benefit in patients truly sensitive to the allergen in question.,False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC4392313,1160,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with clinically important comorbidities, including accelerated cardiovascular risk.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4392313,1161,"The latter is not explained by conventional risk factors (eg, hypertension, obesity), suggesting that additional pathways contribute to adverse outcomes.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4392313,1162,"These may reflect common genetic or environmental aetiological factors or the impact of chronic inflammation on underlying atherosclerotic disease burden, operating through circulating cytokines, immune complexes, complement factors and acute-phase reactants.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4392313,1163,"Furthermore, it is recognised that absolute circulating lipid concentrations are modified in RA, likely reflecting regulatory integration of metabolic and inflammatory molecular networks.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4392313,1164,"In general, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are reduced in active disease and may increase on the initiation of effective therapeutics regardless of modality.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4392313,1165,"Moreover, interpretation of lipid particle concentrations may be further complicated by changes in size and composition associated with inflammation.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4392313,1166,"For example, small LDL-C particles may confer more atherogenic risk than larger LDL-C particles.",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC4392313,1169,"Similarly, the effect of therapy on other lipid particles causally associated with vascular disease, such as lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), and on clotting factors, such as fibrinogen or markers of activated clotting such as D-dimer, is poorly understood.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4392313,1170,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in various inflammatory effector pathways in RA through B-cell, fibroblast and osteoclast activation.",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC4703201,31340,Introduction,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31341,The study of sedentary behavior as an independent risk factor for chronic disease morbidity and mortality has expanded rapidly in recent years [1].,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31342,"Although historically sedentary behavior has been conceptualized as the absence of physical activity (i.e., physical inactivity) [2], it is now recognized as a distinct behavioral domain, characterized by low energy expenditure (<1.5 METS) and a sitting or reclining posture [3].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31343,"An emerging body of epidemiological evidence suggests that sedentary behaviors are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression and psychological well-being [4–12].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31344,"Importantly, many of these associations were observed independent of participation in moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31345,"Further, there is preliminary evidence that the physiological mechanisms through which sedentary behavior negatively impacts health are distinct from the pathways linked to physical activity [13,14].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31346,"Surveillance data indicates that adults accumulate over 7 hours per day of sedentary time [15], yet the ‘dose’ of sedentary behavior that most accurately predicts health risk remains uncertain.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31347,"There are multiple ways of disrupting sedentary time such as through movement, prolonged standing, or brief sit-to-stand transitions.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31348,Approaches for disrupting sedentary time likely vary in terms of their acceptability by different populations and may have differential impacts on health outcomes.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31349,A recent review suggests that physical activity interventions do not appreciably alter sedentary time [16].,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31350,"Thus, there are an emerging number of interventions that explicitly aim to reduce sedentary behavior.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31351,The majority of interventions to date have targeted children or working adults.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31352,"Among the adult studies, the workplace has been the primary setting and interventions have centered on environmental changes including implementing standing desks to promote less sitting [17,18].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31353,"These interventions have shown some efficacy but may not be appropriate in nonworking populations, such as retired older adults.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31354,"Further, most of the interventions have delivered mixed messages encouraging breaks from sitting, prolonged standing, and movement, making it difficult to determine which types of sedentary behavior are most feasible to improve and which types of intervention most effective.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31355,"Most studies have observed reductions in sitting time and increases in standing time with little impact on sit-to-stand transitions [17,18].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31356,"However, prolonged standing may not be feasible or safe for some populations (e.g., older adults), may not be convenient outside of workplaces, and may be more difficult to maintain long term compared to other approaches such as brief sit-to-stand transitions.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31357,"Laboratory studies suggest that the frequency of disrupting sitting is important, and that sit-to-stand transitions can increase postural blood flow, contract muscles, and stimulate biological processes important in disease formation [19–22].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31358,"Therefore, we developed two different intervention approaches for sedentary behavior reduction: 1) reducing overall sitting time and 2) frequent brief sit-to-stand transitions.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4703201,31359,Working and non-working adults aged 50–70 were randomized to each condition to examine the feasibility of each target and preliminary efficacy on objectively measured sedentary behaviors and physical activity.,False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC4984260,33698,"Transabdominal rectal resection following the principles of total mesorectal excision (TME) has been the mainstay treatment for patients with localized rectal cancer for decades.1 While effective in providing local tumour control, TME is associated with significant morbidity and long-lasting consequences.",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5704386,34035,"There was mixed feedback regarding the acceptability of the shoes; however, 11 out of 12 interviewees reported they would be willing to taking part in a longer-term shoe study, which suggests that patients are interested in footwear as an intervention for claudication.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5704386,34036,Our findings contrast that of previous limited research.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5704386,34037,"A smaller study of 21 people with calf claudication showed that commercially-made, rocker-soled unloading shoes acutely increased usual-pace walking ability, with both the total distance walked and the distance at which patients were initially bothered by symptoms being on average 77 m (37%, p < 0.01) and 89 m (91%, p < 0.01) further, respectively, compared with a standard shoe condition [5].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5704386,34038,"The use of different walking assessments prevents a direct comparison with our findings; however, it is important to note that the “bothered distance” is highly subjective (and thus has poor reliability), and that the reported differences were largely explained by one outlier participant who showed improvements of 710 m and 850 m, respectively.",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5704386,34040,"Again, a direct comparison cannot be made because of different walking test procedures, but also because slightly different intervention and control shoes were used.",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5704386,34045,It is unclear why the beneficial effects of unloading shoes on ankle biomechanics seen here and elsewhere [6] did not translate to functional benefit.,False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5704386,34049,"Interestingly, the mean reduction in peak ankle plantarflexion moment was smaller than that reported previously in healthy younger adults (14% vs. 25%) [6].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5704386,34050,"This difference may have been due to the slight alterations that were made for intervention and control shoes in the present study, e.g., the soles of the unloading shoes being made less deep to increase acceptability to participants, and the soles of the control shoes being “filled in” to facilitate participant blinding.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5704386,34051,"However, given that the absolute reduction in peak ankle power generation was of similar magnitude to the difference previously reported between claudication patients and healthy controls (2.437 [SD 0.445] vs. 2.957 [SD 0.686], p < 0.01) [15], we are surprised that changes in walking distances were not observed.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5704386,34052,"It is important to remember that there is no such thing as a “biomechanically inert” shoe to use as a placebo, and we are confident that the shoe design features we selected were appropriate for assessing the functional effects of unloading shoes while maintaining methodological rigor.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5704386,34053,"Nevertheless, further research would be useful to determine the magnitude of calf unloading that is needed to observe an improved walking ability in different claudicants, and to see if engineering of the shoe can produce greater biomechanical effects without compromising safety and acceptability.",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5718075,30079,"Our results are in line with this study, and the high rate of false negative patients in our study (30%) suggests that the decrease in the cyclic stress applied to the cardiovascular system during ARDS under protective ventilation (due to both low VT and decreased respiratory system compliance) is not sufficient to generate a detectable effect on cardiac index in some patients.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5718075,30080,"We therefore hypothesized that the PP-induced increase in intra-abdominal pressure [41] could generate an impediment to venous return, promoting a zone-2 condition in the inferior vena cava in some patients [42] (and hence a pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium), and could explain the high false negative rate in our study.",False,[0],[0],[0]

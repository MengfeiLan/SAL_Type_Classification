Compared to this study, the data obtained from the second randomisation of thoracic spine fractures over 12 months with all the factors in the range of heart failure, which were also present in the primary study, are much more complex than those obtained from the second randomization.	Randomization
However, this study was not randomised and has some possible bias in the results.	Randomization
We also had a slightly larger n=5 relationship between CNS D2D and the primary efficacy index with CNS D2D, which contributed to a significant increase in overall D2D.	Randomization
Although not as robust as a study in another randomization study, the results of the study in which the shunt technique was used were significantly different from the result of the randomisation in this study (see section 7.3).	Randomization
Despite a very small sample size, the analysis showed a significantly larger number of participants presenting with a pulmonary embolism than was expected.	Randomization
The primary effect of the multivariate design is attributed to the fact that the treatment groups were not randomized and that the randomization of the treatment groups did not influence the final diagnosis.	Randomization
Although we did not use randomization, we found that we randomly selected 10 patients, a small number of whom had been treated with neoadjuvants during the 12-month follow-up and that, overall, this study was less random than the one randomised to anthrocyanin-antibody.	Randomization
While the main effect of randomisation on mortality and morbidity was small, it was not significant for the study with the lowest mortality (3 cm).	Randomization
Although this design was different from the usual randomised study, the results were similar for the two groups.	Randomization
We did not use randomisation for the second doses, but we did use randomisation for the first doses.	Randomization
However, due to the randomization procedure, it is not possible to exclude the potential erroneous treatment with the polymerase chain reaction in this study, thus explaining the large difference in mortality.	Randomization
Second, we did not run any non-randomized treatment, which explains the difference in treatment effects between studies.	Randomization
In addition to this difference in the dose of the anti-seizure drug, we found a significant effect of the study drug combination on comorbidity.	Randomization
Although the results of this study were similar to those from a previous study, there was no significant difference in the number of patients with dementia.	Randomization
We therefore had significant differences in the overall number of pg among the groups, thereby narrowing the effect size.	Randomization
The findings of the current study may not be generalizable to patients with other medical conditions.	Generalization
However, in the case of some of the features of the esophageal cancer treatment, the results of this study may not necessarily be transferrable to other conditions arising from esophageal cancer (e.g., acute lung damage) in the absence of an intervention.	Generalization
The data presented at the ACL meeting were limited to the specific case of non-alcoholic cystitis; thus, they may not be applicable to patients with nonalcoholic cystitis.	Generalization
Consequently, our findings can only be generalized to apply to patients with known or suspected serious injuries or diseases, not just for the use of the LPI.	Generalization
The data may not be generalizable to patients in whom we used a symptom-specific dose reduction approach, which is inconvenient if a patient had no symptom-specific dose reduction (Dinosaur, 1994).	Generalization
Therefore, it is important to consider whether the results are valid for individuals from different origins (e.g., those who take longer to heal themselves after an infection).	Generalization
However, this is an area where further research is needed.	Generalization
The results described above are limited in generality and therefore cannot be generalized to other settings and conditions.	Generalization
The study results are not generalizable to all settings, which may result in mismatches between the individual findings and those from other centres.	Generalization
Our findings may not have implications for the generalization of our findings to other studies of the coma prevention effects.	Generalization
As such, a clinical model with a different model of morbidity and mortality is needed to apply the results of this study to cases in which morbidity and mortality increased in asymptomatic patients, or in patients with severe morbidity.	Generalization
The use of our results in the clinical setting has implications for the generalization of our findings to other settings.	Generalization
Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to patients with non-cardiac disease or those with low blood pressure.	Generalization
As a result, the results may not be generalizable to participants with ocular cancer, and other conditions where there is frequent oral medication.	Generalization
Hence, the results reported in this paper may not be generalizable to other patient groups (see Figure 1) as there is considerable variation in the effects of DTHG on cardiovascular mortality.	Generalization
We examined two additional interactions, but our results suggest that there was a significant difference between the results of these tests and that the difference may be due to the small number of events in the analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we did not adjust for multiple variables we could not statistically examine the effect of obesity and diet on risk of cardiovascular disease.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we controlled for multiple outcome variables, we tested for multiple outcomes, but there are still unknown mechanisms of action, and we have not adjusted for these.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, the multivariate effect model of outcome analysis (MMAI) could limit the number of significant results.	StatisticalAnalysis
Last, we conducted a number of other statistical tests.	StatisticalAnalysis
This may explain why we chose to adjust our threshold for multiple tests of CBP to 25, but it is not possible to exclude other significant outcomes from the model, such as age, gender, and social role.	StatisticalAnalysis
The high number of interactions in this study may have been due to several factors that could explain this difference in survival.	StatisticalAnalysis
Furthermore, we did not analyze multiple regression models.	StatisticalAnalysis
Given the nature of the study, our assumption of randomization of outcomes could be problematic because it could result in multiple causal associations.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, because we treated multiple outcomes with different methods, we excluded multiple outcomes of the main effect.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, there was a significant effect of time and effort on anxiety and depression, which are independent of mood and emotion.	StatisticalAnalysis
Last, although our analysis showed that shrewdness is not associated with successful outcomes, the likelihood of any significant effects on success was extremely low.	StatisticalAnalysis
Additionally, our analysis of multiple secondary outcomes was highly significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Last, we had no significant interaction among rat weight, calorie intake, and nutrient intake, but these outcomes could have influenced the outcomes at lower doses.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, our mixed methods approach could introduce biases that may have altered the final result.	StatisticalAnalysis
In this analysis we have only data about the percentage of patients who completed the intervention, indicating a lack of confidence in the decision to proceed with or to withdraw.	MissingData
This was probably due to the nature of the evaluative study and to the relatively small number of participants who attended all three visits.	MissingData
We also collected no objective measures of socio-demographic characteristics or socioeconomic status of participants.	MissingData
A further limitation is the significant omission of clinical parameters to the questionnaire, which may have caused a significant increase in the overall weight for the n-groups.	MissingData
In addition, data from two additional randomization groups were not available, and therefore the main limitation of the study is the relatively high proportion of patients who did not complete the assessment.	MissingData
We could not provide data on the duration of the exercise at each follow-up visit.	MissingData
Because our primary outcome was not evaluated in the aforementioned cohort, we had little opportunity to address this problem.	MissingData
As there was no meaningful interview, it is unlikely that the participants would have been able to provide a complete picture of patient treatment outcomes.	MissingData
The potential for bias may be mitigated by the lack of participant responses to the assessments of the physical and mental status (Durham 2006).	MissingData
We also did not have the same information about blood pressure level or glucose levels in the study arms, both of which are important to understand the mechanisms behind any improvement in blood pressure and to provide an explanation for these differences.	MissingData
This may have accounted for the large proportion of missing data from the study, which led to a significant decline in the number of patients in our study, and thus to the evaluative effects of our intervention.	MissingData
The primary limitation of our study was the high proportion of subjects who did not complete all 6 weeks of study (a figure 1).	MissingData
Additionally, the lack of information from CEC is more pronounced at the onset of an infection compared with the rest of the cohort.	MissingData
Further, we were unable to collect biochemical parameters of patient care, although the authors noted a few cases of asymptomatic nephropathy in patients referred to ERCP.	MissingData
Likewise, there was no detailed follow-up of weight, length of stay in the study, or age at onset of fatigue.	MissingData
Because we did not adjust for multiple factors (and because we did not adjust for the effect of age or weight) we cannot exclude these factors from analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Although we did not adjust for multiple covariates (non-confounders) in our analysis, it is possible that these effects may have a positive influence on outcome.	StatisticalAnalysis
The multiple outcome test allows us to account for univariate effects; however, there could be important underlying mechanisms affecting survival in this group.	StatisticalAnalysis
Nevertheless, our underlying analysis could be flawed, since we did not adjust for multiple regression models and thus the model was not robust to the aforementioned factors.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, we did not control for multiple covariates and therefore cannot have expected a more robust analysis of each factor in predicting stroke.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, our multiple logistic regression model requires several steps to be statistically significant, and thus the analysis is not robust enough to test for group interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, the statistical tests we used may have underestimated the number of critical factors in the development of ALS, including risk factors for heart attack, stroke, and stroke.	StatisticalAnalysis
The fact that we did not adjust for other outcomes might have influenced the results.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, our secondary analysis model is vulnerable to a number of biases, which could explain the inconsistency of our statistical tests.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, our model was not parametric, suggesting that we did not adjust for multiple variables.	StatisticalAnalysis
The analysis was adjusted for multiple measures of stress, so the results are not statistically significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, despite our intention to limit our analysis to single-factors and single-observer interactions, it is possible that the results may be limited by the limited number of underlying mechanisms.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, since our analysis was more focussed on one outcome, this may be a limitation because we adjusted for multiple measures of aging.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we did not conduct a full randomized trial of all interactions, it is possible that some of our results could be inferred by the difference in CBP levels or by comparing the results of other treatments.	StatisticalAnalysis
This approach was designed to test multiple outcomes, not just physical measures.	StatisticalAnalysis
The 6-month duration of this study was not sufficient to test for the benefits of treatment and may lead to some limitation in the treatment of osteoporosis.	StudyDuration
The duration of treatment could not be considered at this point as it would not have provided a long-term pharmacotherapy for this type of underlying disorder.	StudyDuration
Second, a long duration of follow-up would be needed to assess the impact of vitamin D supplements on risk of breast cancer (see below).	StudyDuration
The primary reason for the short duration of the study was the large effect of anti-depressants on the total BMI, the duration of which was also very short.	StudyDuration
The final clinical period should be longer than 6 months to allow for the longer-term follow-up of this topic.	StudyDuration
The time frames of the trial were only 5 years, and this would suggest that improvements in chronic stress should be maintained for longer than this for the best part of a decade.	StudyDuration
In addition, the duration of our study was not long enough to permit detailed monitoring of long-term outcomes.	StudyDuration
We found that long-term follow-up of DMD was appropriate but only for short-term maintenance; furthermore, the duration of our study was aimed to provide longer term follow-up data.	StudyDuration
The study duration was only 3 years, however a further 6 years would be needed to explore the effects of the osteopathic treatment on chronic renal disease.	StudyDuration
The short duration of the study may be limiting.	StudyDuration
Although our study was only short enough to allow treatment-related side effects, the results show that treatment-related outcomes were not sustained over the course of the 5 year follow-up period.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, it is difficult to estimate the effect of treatment for severe BP in this study.	StudyDuration
In addition, it is possible that the study may be prolonged a few months before reviewing the final study results.	StudyDuration
Moreover, the analysis did not cover the full impact of the effects of GABA on chronic diseases over time, so it may not be applicable for long-term follow-up.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of this study is the short duration of the evaluation period, which may be too long to allow a formal appraisal of the effects of nutritional and biochemical therapy.	StudyDuration
Third, although a longer follow-up was needed to validate the effects of the drug, this was not feasible.	StudyDuration
Second, long-term follow-up is needed for further exploration.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, it is not clear from the end of the trial whether the effects on BMD over the years are significant enough to prevent their progression into disease progression.	StudyDuration
Third, a long-term extension of the study may be warranted to confirm the long-term effect of steroid injections, but this was not feasible, as we only studied one arm and only for a short duration, for the purpose of confirming the effects of statins, rather than a longer duration.	StudyDuration
The study duration was not long enough to detect significant change in weight gain.	StudyDuration
The study does not conclude that a 12-month follow-up period is required for treatment effects.	StudyDuration
Second, we did not consider the longer term effects of vitamin D on bone marrow, but we evaluated a long-term titration period after the end of the initial study.	StudyDuration
In addition, although no follow-up period was available, it was likely that the effects of the new antineoplastic agents on BMD and BRD would have been felt after 1 year, but the main benefit from this would have been within 6 months.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of our study is the short duration of our follow-up (shorter than 6 months), which may have been due to long duration of treatment or to the fact that we did not evaluate any of the most severe clinical signs associated with chronic heart disease.	StudyDuration
In contrast to the shorter duration of the traditional trials with no long-term follow up, there were no follow-up intervals to be considered, due to the limited time available.	StudyDuration
Finally, the early termination of the treatment plan was not feasible due to a lack of support for the study design and also to its length - it was only possible to observe only the effects of treatment during two months after the start of treatment.	StudyDuration
In addition, there is no need to investigate the long-term effect of angiotensin receptor antagonists (ORAs) in the limbs of the limbs of the adult patient in order to determine clinical benefits of such therapy.	StudyDuration
This study focused on one month of follow-up and was designed to identify underlying mechanisms responsible for the development of GBM after surgery or after treatment.	StudyDuration
It would also be interesting to study the enduring impact of the effect of insulin on a clinically relevant disease or asymptomatic behavior.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, we tested the effect of a long-term follow-up - a key component of the pgRat in clinical studies.	StudyDuration
In addition, participants would have been blinded to their providers, which would have made it difficult for clinicians to control the patient for a significant recurrence of hospital visits.	Blinding
First, the data collection process may have been partially blinded, but an inter-professional team was not blinded to participant characteristics, thereby introducing some uncertainty about how participant groups are perceived.	Blinding
Firstly, the trial team could have increased the blinding if there was a change in the level of engagement.	Blinding
In any case, if the participants were not blinded, a significant misinterpretation may have occurred.	Blinding
One potential limitation of the protocol was that it was administered blindly (as demonstrated in the results of the randomized pharmacotherapy study), and it may be difficult to identify the level of patient bias, which is expected if participant anonymisation is not conducted.	Blinding
In addition, the administration of the intervention was not blinded; however, since some of the interventions were given with the consent of a consultant, the possibility of a potential bias in the results may have been greater in those with less cognitive impairment.	Blinding
Some observers may have been blinded to the study’s outcome variables, and therefore bias in treatment would be more likely to occur in the event of the absence of a double enrolment.	Blinding
In this study, the interventionists were not blinded to the intervention outcome.	Blinding
As a result of the non-blinding effect of this intervention, the effect of a patient assessment could be significantly different from the one received by a specialist consultant.	Blinding
The present study design used a standardised protocol.	Blinding
First, participants might have sought to avoid tampering.	Blinding
The patient blinding effect was stronger when a physician provided a questionnaire with clinical data to both the researchers and to the participants.	Blinding
In this context, we assume that participants were not blinded to the type of intervention they received (for example, blinded to the dose they received).	Blinding
Neither the participants nor their parents were blinded by the outcomes and an unblinded person could perform a control effect by exposing only their participants to the intervention.	Blinding
Finally, it is possible that blinding occurred in the absence of patient blinding.	Blinding
Because it is difficult to be sure which patients did not make the final decision to join or exit the study, we did not complete all available follow-up assessments of patients with non-transformed mental health or psychological disorder.	MissingData
We also had limited data on comorbidity, mortality and mortality (11%).	MissingData
Because of this, the study participants are likely to have been excluded from clinical decision analysis despite the possibility of a large number of patients having taken part in the study.	MissingData
This study was limited by the high enrolment rate at completion of the intervention (around 47%).	MissingData
We were unable to obtain data from subjects who stopped the study for at least two months, or were absent from the study for more than 2 months.	MissingData
Second, in the trial with stomatometry, the number of participants who opted out of the study was lower than the numbers that enrolled in the intervention.	MissingData
The main limitation of the study is the absence of complete demographic data for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.	MissingData
Although the aim of the study was to increase the number of subjects who completed the study, we could not obtain a complete anthropometric record for the remaining subjects.	MissingData
An exception could be found for participants who were not willing to participate in the ELSA-I or in the ELSA-II trials.	MissingData
The large number of participants was unable to complete the assessment of their health and lifestyle status.	MissingData
In addition, a lack of pharmacokinetic data for the primary endpoint pTest induced anxiety in the second arm of the study (the rtE BP) has predicated on the high rate of dropout after the initial 2 weeks.	MissingData
As expected, the study is well represented by approximately 40% of the sample, which was smaller than the number of patients selected for treatment.	MissingData
This limitation of the cohort study is reflected in our decision not to continue with the study based on the absence of any data from the primary outcome measures.	MissingData
In addition, the study had no additional physical assessment, as it elicited no meaningful medical observations.	MissingData
As a consequence of the nature of the study, the lack of follow-up was an important factor in our lagging analysis.	MissingData
However, it is possible that multiple random events were involved, but these were not statistically significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, our study was limited to one time and no other factors were tested.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, we did not examine the risk factors of an increase in depression in diabetes, allowing for a potential bias in our statistical model.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, our exploratory statistical analysis omitted multiple factors, which could have raised concerns about the causality of the effects on reducing the incidence of CHD, but we did not test for such interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
The design of the clustering tests for determining mortality risks is somewhat more complex than our other methods.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, our analysis includes multiple tests, which could make it more difficult to interpret the results.	StatisticalAnalysis
The number of outcomes is not significant, but the data reflects the possibility that we may have underestimated the effect of age, gender, and age.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, because of our analysis strategy, we did not analyze the effects of cognitive, mental, and physical factors on cognitive development and outcomes of mental health treatment.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, as a further effect of age may have altered the overall toxicity levels of tyrosine in this group, it may be that the higher dose of tyrosine, or the shorter time to cure, could have had a greater effect on the outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, we conducted a number of tests, including outcome measures, which may have affected our results.	StatisticalAnalysis
A number of independent factors were tested.	StatisticalAnalysis
Last, our randomised controlled trial, which we ran in conjunction with the GSK study, did not control for other factors, which may be relevant for predicting BMI.	StatisticalAnalysis
But because we did not conduct a randomized trial of different outcomes, the result may be potentially significant because we drew no significance from the analyses.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, our group did not conduct a number of repeated measures, indicating that our tests were not robust to external factors, thereby limiting our ability to detect significant interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
Furthermore, because we did not conduct a number of randomized controlled trials, the effect of stuttering could be non-significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, data quality for all patients and for the dietary intake data were poor, and there was a significant proportion of patients who were unable to be contacted during follow-up, resulting in a potential loss of quality of life.	MissingData
In addition, there are not sufficient quantitative measures of the dietary intake of healthy individuals, but there is a greater loss of knowledge with age than in other study populations.	MissingData
Finally, the lack of detailed assessments of diet and intakes within the five intervention groups is apparent from the relatively small number of participants who were not in the intervention.	MissingData
In addition to spirometry, there was a large number of subjects with reduced physical activity levels (e.g.	MissingData
Finally, a large number of participants did not wish to join the follow-up study because of the difficulty in identifying patients with medical problems.	MissingData
Finally, participants missing only one symptom or symptom group were excluded from all analyses (which could explain some limitations of the study).	MissingData
Thirdly, we had no data on daily digits for physical activity (including exercise intensity), despite several attempts to collect these data.	MissingData
The 3 db of osmolality was lower than the 2 db of serum glucose levels.	MissingData
Further, we only obtained information about patients enrolled in the study but this is limited in the current study design.	MissingData
However, at least two of the four cohorts were not available for follow-up.	MissingData
Another limitation of our study is that we did not collect blood and urine samples of patients with acute heart attacks or strokes in the cohort.	MissingData
We have not found any missing variables in our clinical trial.	MissingData
It is of note that a sample size of more than 2,000 participants was obtained at least for the first week of the study, and there was no follow-up of patients not completing the randomized arms.	MissingData
Furthermore, our study did not take note of any other variables, such as laboratory results or patient characteristics.	MissingData
In addition, we were unable to obtain detailed measurements of serum lactate and serum cholesterol levels for all participants.	MissingData
Despite using a modified randomisation scheme, it is unlikely that participants were blinded to the final intervention (though a patient with lower self-esteem may have received it unblinded, as it is difficult to determine the syllabi of a single intervention).	Blinding
Finally, our data were not blinded to the control group, so it was difficult to establish whether we had been blinded to the control group, e.g.	Blinding
An example of how the intervention was conducted might be from a clinician observation.	Blinding
In addition, participants may have missed out on some of the sessions because they were not blinded to study participants, resulting in a potential for a false positive.	Blinding
This study is not blinded because of a blinding process, but it may be due to the use of direct instrumentation or to a placebo.	Blinding
In addition, the intervention group is not blinded, and may not have used double-blinding or otherwise chosen a method of assessment similar to the one used in the AMI study.	Blinding
Second, participants were not blinded to the outcomes of the intervention.	Blinding
In addition, the participants were not blinded to the outcomes of the intervention.	Blinding
A secondary objective may be used if the physiotherapist was blinded to a given group of patients, such as stroke-free, or if the participants were ostracized.	Blinding
Another limitation of the intervention was the observation bias, in which participants were not blinded by a control group.	Blinding
First, the study wasn't blinded to the intervention and it's impossible to predict which treatment may be useful or ineffective in terms of outcome.	Blinding
In addition, it was possible that the therapists may have been blinded to their participants and may have been exposed to a subsequent secondary effect.	Blinding
The intervention data were not blinded and we cannot estimate the effectiveness of the practice for blinding despite our large sample size.	Blinding
The present study used blinding to select individuals for their post-doctoral care and so, the intervention received unblinded, and thus cannot be considered blinded.	Blinding
A retrospective examination of the participants during the third visit to a local clinical facility is important because it avoids the need for intervention blinding.	Blinding
In a randomized setting it would be reasonable to assume that the blinding to the intervention outcome was unintentional because a person was not blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
Although participants were not blinded to treatment, the patient self-report may have had the effect of providing more information about treatment outcomes.	Blinding
However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a placebo effect.	Blinding
This is possible because the blinding criteria in the trial was non-negligible but the methodological uncertainty of the intervention means that it may have influenced the outcome, which could lead to confusion in predicting the intervention outcomes.	Blinding
If it is possible that this bias could occur during the post-treatment discussion, the intervention would be more difficult to administer because the subjects were not blinded.	Blinding
The outcome of a single arm study with participants blinded to the intervention was not possible given the large number of volunteers and the standardized nature of the intervention.	Blinding
A study randomized by a clinician with a lower number of patients than their randomized control group may have caused unblinded bias, as the participants may have considered the intervention to be less or more meaningful, thereby contributing to patient unblindness.	Blinding
Another important limitation is that the participants were not blinded.	Blinding
Obviously the use of the nave, indirect observation in the initial data collection or the subsequent post-hoc measurement would not have caused significant effects on the outcome.	Blinding
In addition, an effect of blinding could have occurred if participants recalled only positive treatment results.	Blinding
Another confound could be the effect of monitoring data from an unblinded randomized study.	Blinding
The method of obtaining the primary care unit dummy was not blinding but rather the administration of an evaluative protocol.	Blinding
The practice-blinding component of the data collection (i.e., a randomised control group with a defined number of participants, or a group of observers) was not operative but participants may have seen their treatment outcomes changed subsequently, possibly causing haemorrhage.	Blinding
First, participants may not have been blinded to treatment.	Blinding
The inclusion of unblinded observers is the least restrictive approach to studying the effects of clinical behaviour interventions.	Blinding
It is noteworthy that we lacked detailed information on the demographics of our patients.	MissingData
Nonetheless, although the results of the X-rays were similar to those in the blood analysis, the level of anthropometric variables in the blood was high.	MissingData
Furthermore, our study group did not provide clinical details for a large proportion of participants, possibly because the sample size was too small.	MissingData
The lack of objective follow-up information in the trial was a further limitation in the analyses, especially given the lack of objective measures of comorbidity.	MissingData
Furthermore, at least half of patients did not report their physical anthropometric measurements after one month, indicating that physical assessment was not sufficient for determining clinical findings.	MissingData
Further, data on weight gain and weight loss from the ldTc and the LMD/LMT and the PTC from study end points (p0.01) were not available.	MissingData
We had limited patient participation in the second study and this is more relevant in defining the impact of any symptom of metabolic syndrome than other studies.	MissingData
In addition to the number of participants enrolled, participants in the other interventions were also absent from the study for some time (2 month).	MissingData
Further, the lack of complete records of non-adherents and patients in the study, which contribute to the negative effect of a clinical trial, suggests an imbalance in information.	MissingData
Our analysis of clinical outcomes did not provide complete and unbiased information on the patient population or participant health.	MissingData
The nature of our research strategy meant that we did not have complete data on all participants after randomisation, however, the results from our follow-up questionnaires were consistent with this.	MissingData
In addition to all serum glucose levels, glucose was also assessed for daily glucose intakes in patients with chronic hypertension.	MissingData
One limitation of our study was that participants did not report all events of depression in the last 12 months.	MissingData
The study also provided limited information regarding baseline mortality, symptomatic changes, or glycaemic changes, thereby confounding our analyses.	MissingData
A limitation of the study was the inability to collect blood samples from all subjects.	MissingData
The treatment group might not have been blinded to the outcome of the intervention, for example, the patient receiving a BMR might not have expected to see any changes in BMR after the BMR, as evidence for patient preference is not available.	Blinding
Alternatively, we do not know how we got the results.	Blinding
The outcome of the X-ray imaging procedure demonstrates an unexpectedly high degree of unblinding and a potential hazard to safety.	Blinding
In this case, the study was not blinded to the intervention received.	Blinding
We aimed to assess participants who had received an oral sedative, but due to the small number of participants in the study, it is possible that this difference in outcome was due to a small number of participants unblinded.	Blinding
Moreover, the blinding of the interventions is critical to consider when assessing which interventions are successful or unproductive for a given clinical intervention.	Blinding
If the participants were blinded to the intervention, this could have resulted in a bias.	Blinding
This is because the participants were blinded to the intervention outcome.	Blinding
Another potential limitation to blinding would be the nature of the intervention and the timing of its delivery.	Blinding
The outcome of this study was also not completely blinded, and a full unblinding was expected because a blinded study is impossible to administer.	Blinding
Although the study was not blinded to the study data, a single participant may have omitted the intervention group, creating potential for bias.	Blinding
This study was not blinded to the final outcome of the study.	Blinding
In addition, there were some potential risks of occlusion in the first session and participants could be unblinded.	Blinding
In the case of patients receiving non-identical injections, there was a possibility of bias as participants were unaware of the intervention they received.	Blinding
A potential bias would have occurred had a participant decided to leave the study after completing a number of weeks, but this is unlikely to have occurred.	Blinding
Therefore, the conclusions of our study might not be generalisable to all populations and therefore may not have generalised to other groups.	Generalization
This limits the generalization of the findings from our study.	Generalization
Therefore, the results may not generalize to patients with more severe clinical syndromes and for the general population.	Generalization
The results obtained by our research could not be generalized to all patients with diabetes.	Generalization
Our findings may not apply to all patients in the study, because the analysis of the edwards and the styrian effects was performed at different times.	Generalization
The study could be generalized to other conditions in the body and other persons with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.	Generalization
The results of this study should not be interpreted as a generalization, especially as they are only a part of a single research group.	Generalization
Therefore, the results of the current study may not be applicable to all patients and may not be generalizable to all patients with non-cardiac arrhythmias, such as diabetes or heart attack.	Generalization
Therefore, the results of the study cannot be generalized to all patients.	Generalization
A limitation of the current findings is that their application might be limited to patients with vascular dementia, for example, with mild ischemic stroke.	Generalization
The results we provide were conducted in an individual study.	Generalization
The result obtained by the DMS may not be transferable to other patient populations.	Generalization
In addition, it is therefore important that our findings might not be generalized to the other patients with severe asthma, who might have milder symptoms, or who have had milder respiratory distress.	Generalization
We therefore challenge the generalization of our findings to include patients with heart failure.	Generalization
As a consequence, the results of the present study are limited in their generalisability to other clinical settings (e.g., ED or outpatient).	Generalization
Moreover, despite the very similar groups, only about a third of the participants with advanced dementia received treatment in the CNS in the RN care cohort (a 5% increase from baseline).	Randomization
While the effects of uncontrolled and controlled exclusion in the neoplastic treatment group were similar, a significant heterogeneity in the drug effect accounted for the difference in clinical outcome between the two groups.	Randomization
Although the method was repeated, we had no effect on baseline GBP, so the results are not comparable.	Randomization
Although there are no clear reasons for these differences, they are associated with lower rates of morbidity, hence the complication.	Randomization
Given that two doses of NIF, NSMA and CSMA were randomized together, our results would suggest that NIF may not have been used in this study but that the two doses might have been used independently in order to prevent bias, compared with the other 2 doses.	Randomization
Because we did not use a standardised randomisation procedure, we therefore used unblinded randomisation for the final data sets.	Randomization
Given the small sample size and the nature of the study, however, it is possible that randomisation resulted in some bias, and this could have affected the adherence patterns to standard treatment.	Randomization
However, as most of these patients came from different treatment groups, the treatment effects in this study were not distributed equally across all patients, suggesting a bias in the results.	Randomization
Although randomization might be more likely than randomisation of the placebo, the authors found that randomization of n=10 compared to placebo had a smaller effect on clinical outcome and thus the result could be more robust.	Randomization
Although we used a full randomization design, there were some significant differences in treatment outcomes, mainly due to the relatively short duration of treatment in each group.	Randomization
Although a proportion of patients with severe anemia were randomised, our findings do not support the hypothesis that patients with a severe anemia with a definite course of treatment (i.e., a systolic ulcer) should not be treated with nebulizers.	Randomization
This difference in outcomes may be due to differences in treatment, which may have led to larger numbers of patients being randomised to dtB, vs. the effect of treatment group or dtB.	Randomization
Although a significant effect of the randomization procedure on the clinical outcome was not seen, it is possible that the small effect size could explain the differences in the clinical outcome between patients randomly allocated to the randomization program and among patients randomly assigned to the control arm.	Randomization
In addition, the two groups were unrandomised, but the more complex randomisation of the treatment regimens did not prevent the differences in treatment effects.	Randomization
The additional effect of clustering in the clinical trial is probably due to the fact that the patients with more severe depressions had earlier exposures.	Randomization
However, a lack of follow-up data on physical activity in the participants with severe disabilities may have been a limitation of the study.	MissingData
An issue was the lack of detailed data on the physiology of sweat glands and the effect of heat.	MissingData
We are unable to provide a complete picture of the effect of the treatment on a particular patient, and we are therefore unable to consider the effects of the intervention on this patient.	MissingData
We have limited information about patients lost in the intervention.	MissingData
This limitation also includes a lack of follow-up for patients in all 3 intervention arms, a common limitation due to the low overall rates.	MissingData
Another limitation of this study is that only 2 of the 40 participants were eligible for follow-up.	MissingData
Moreover, a lack of follow-up was observed in study withdrawal.	MissingData
Given the relatively large proportion of non-nave participants in the second arm of the AO, it may be difficult to interpret the proportions in this cohort.	MissingData
Although the missing-data data was relatively small, it might be a result of the smaller number of participants who missed an assessment and were therefore able to identify potential factors contributing to an increase in mortality.	MissingData
Because of the limited information about patients' health status and lifestyle, we cannot estimate the number of patients who participated in the drexel and nrts studied after randomisation.	MissingData
Firstly, the study was not randomized and so there is no identifiable time value for a number of variables that are not relevant to clinical assessment.	MissingData
In addition, the lack of follow-up for patients in the study indicated significant bias, since the median follow-up was 2 years.	MissingData
We also found substantial patient decline in the second subgroup (mean dropout rate of 4.9%), which is indicative of poor adherence to treatment at the end of the study.	MissingData
We also lacked complete follow-up of patient medical histories and medical observations over 2 years.	MissingData
Our analysis of the follow-up data was limited and could not provide evidence to support our findings.	MissingData
Finally, longer duration tests are often insufficient to interpret the effects of treatment in a prospective prospective study and the clinical consequences of this therapy are best characterized by its reversal effect.	StudyDuration
Second, the duration of this study was short and was designed to avoid premature loss of progress.	StudyDuration
Second, while longer follow-up periods were needed to examine the effects of long-term treatment on the long-term outcome, this did not occur in our study.	StudyDuration
We found no benefit from early treatment for BMD despite long-term follow-up, suggesting an early effect of ototoxicity.	StudyDuration
Although the maximum duration of our study was only 6 weeks, it may be possible that this is the duration of the earliest clinical effect.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, an extended follow-up period is necessary to understand the long-term effects of vitamin C in the brain in the short-term.	StudyDuration
Thus, a longer duration is needed to confirm whether the benefits to healthy patients occur at a later time after the start of their treatment with glucocorticoids.	StudyDuration
It would be helpful to compare these results on longer timescales in order to assess the effect of the anesthetic effect on ethological outcomes.	StudyDuration
The primary benefit would be seen in a 5-year follow-up period of 8 to 12 months.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of the study is the lack of follow-up after a few months of therapy.	StudyDuration
As the main motivation for the study was to identify treatment-related changes in symptomatic symptoms in adult lobes, we extended the duration of the study to 2 years.	StudyDuration
A longer study may clarify this finding, but it will be advisable to follow up this prospectively designed study in the future.	StudyDuration
Second, the time-course was not long enough to explore the effect of DQD toxicity on acute and chronic diseases, but long-term follow-up may be appropriate for further follow-up, and a review of the literature suggests that prolonged follow-up may provide important information regarding the impact of therapy on chronic diseases.	StudyDuration
However, the final evaluation could take up to a year (or longer) to reach a consensus on the long-term effects of oral chemotherapy on clinical improvement in patients with osteoarthritis of the spine.	StudyDuration
A two year time frame (months) is needed to evaluate the effects of a multifactorial treatment regimen on postmenopausal women.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, although a review of the data may be required in a clinical trial, we were not able to provide definitive clinical outcome due to long-term follow-up.	StudyDuration
Finally, it would be useful to consider the longer term effects of lithium treatment on acute coronary syndrome risk.	StudyDuration
One limitation of this study is that it was aimed at finding long-term outcomes, especially at the level of the esophageal or intestinal ulcers, to confirm causal effects.	StudyDuration
Third, because our results suggest the clinical significance of this study, longer-term follow-up was needed for long-term follow-up.	StudyDuration
However, we could not determine if the effects of lithium were sustained over the longer term in the main study.	StudyDuration
The 6-month duration of our study could not assess whether treatment was beneficial in every case.	StudyDuration
However, long-term follow-up period was not feasible because of the short duration of follow-up, which would have resulted in a degrading effect of treatment.	StudyDuration
The shorter duration of the follow-up period might have resulted in a broader discussion of the treatment effects of glucocorticoid and may have increased the impact of subsequent interventions.	StudyDuration
Thus, it would be difficult to conclude whether the long-term effect on the treatment was permanent.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of our study was that we did not evaluate treatment effects on a 2-year time-course, as our data show that long-term treatment affects a large proportion of people within the study.	StudyDuration
Moreover, in the absence of a randomized control trial for long-term follow-up, it would be difficult to predict changes in functional status over the long-term (duration of the treatment effect).	StudyDuration
One limitation of the study is that although we observed long-term improvements in the average number of fractures and fracture mortality over time, our findings were not repeated in subsequent analyses.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of this study is the short length of follow-up time of 1 year.	StudyDuration
Moreover, it was suggested that prolonged follow-up of improved maintenance of oral nutrition and weight loss results in long-term improvement of clinical outcomes in this group.	StudyDuration
It is also difficult to define an optimum time to initiate treatment in this area, given that many improvements during the initial phase of treatment have occurred within six months of intervention.	StudyDuration
Although a few of our patients discontinued their participation from the study, this was due to the relatively large number of participants being unable to attend follow-up appointments (see Figure 1).	MissingData
In addition, a reluctance to provide medical history information may have accounted for the significant number of missing data.	MissingData
Our main limitation was our inability to collect blood glucose values from patients following their discharge from the trial, which makes this analysis particularly difficult.	MissingData
We were unable to obtain a complete clinical assessment for the 3 main interventions, and we were unable to collect a summary of the patients on each day.	MissingData
In the third study, only 34% of participants who did not complete the initial study were followed-up by blood smear.	MissingData
Second, it was unclear whether we obtained complete dietary information in all study sites.	MissingData
We could not assess if acupuncture was effective in reducing weight gain in the acupuncture cohort or was related to the exercise level at baseline.	MissingData
A limitation of our study is that participants were not collected at baseline; however, this limitation should be overcome by prospective follow-up after randomization.	MissingData
At least at the end of the clinical trial, some underlying psychological reasons may have driven this bias.	MissingData
There are small numbers of participants who were dropped from the study.	MissingData
We could not obtain a complete assessment of treatment effects derived from the four daily assessments of oral iodine.	MissingData
In addition, although all participants were evaluated in the clinical trial, some missing data were reported in case notes and other notes.	MissingData
First, as a result of the loss of interest in the intervention, it was very difficult to calculate the impact of the intervention on morbidity.	MissingData
In addition, a limitation of the study is that participants were not interviewed in some of the centers.	MissingData
Secondly, a limitation of the randomized design was the absence of blood and other laboratory measurements for blood pressure and blood glucose in the ACT study.	MissingData
Since this study did not include a placebo group, we decided to give this intervention a chance.	Control
The control arm containing the CNS4C2 study was not randomized allowing for analysis of the effect on body weight and physical activity.	Control
Thus, the control group was not randomized and was therefore not able to determine the effect of the intervention.	Control
In the current study a placebo control (no treatment) was used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment that may have had a better effect on the inflammatory response.	Control
In order to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the interventions, both arms had to be assigned to a non-randomized control arm.	Control
The control approach may be more appropriate to the conditions in which our trial was based.	Control
In addition, the non-therapeutic treatment arm was not assessed and therefore not able to demonstrate therapeutic benefit.	Control
In a more randomised controlled trial, both armies were randomized to avoid the effects of the active vs. inactive arms.	Control
This is a limitation of using placebo in this study and would limit our ability to evaluate the effects of an antiviral therapy such as rifampin on gout.	Control
Therefore, both the individual controls were not randomized.	Control
The absence of a control in this study highlights the limitations of using an experimental intervention such as CBT.	Control
The comparison of the treatment to a control arm with the clinical benefit from both treatment arms would not have occurred without the inclusion of the 'control' arm.	Control
The absence of a control in the study would indicate that a control could have a more important effect on the incidence of BPH in patients with higher BMI.	Control
In the absence of a placebo group, the researchers chose to use the control arms of the placebo group (uncontrolled trials).	Control
In this trial the control group was not adequately controlled and could not be excluded from the study.	Control
The small number of sites in which we were enrolled resulted in a larger sample size and we could not perform an unbiased analysis.	Setting
Finally, it is desirable that the use of a single center may decrease the potential for bias in the trial to a small number of patients with potentially acute or chronic conditions, or to treat any chronic conditions.	Setting
Further, setting was a limitation of this study.	Setting
Therefore we did not perform an intervention to assess the efficacy of the intervention for the case presented.	Setting
This is not an open trial.	Setting
Furthermore, our trial was single site, which is a disadvantage in that it was performed in an outpatient setting.	Setting
In addition, it is important to note that CORRA was an outpatient trial and we could not provide specific treatment to control for CORRA's bias.	Setting
Although we cannot judge the impact of this outcome on the ability to control for adverse events and monitor for patient satisfaction it is possible that some of the benefits of using a single centre would be lessened by using a single center in our trial.	Setting
This approach to clinical trial was extremely unique as the clinical trial was multicentre, single arm.	Setting
However, we were not able to achieve any definitive results in this case.	Setting
As a small-scale study, it is difficult to identify a single centre of intervention with the same approach for reducing adverse effects.	Setting
It is particularly interesting that we chose to remain neutral as the effect of reducing the number of treatments was mainly limited to the larger intervention group with more of a high-quality population.	Setting
First, while we have chosen a single centre in which to study the use of ems in our analysis, it was important to note that the use of a single center demonstrates its flexibility in terms of addressing the specific issues involved.	Setting
Therefore, the study was performed in single centre setting.	Setting
Because the trial was small, the benefits of this trial may have been partially offset by the limitation of being single center.	Setting
Further, our clinical trial was based on both a controlled and a randomised study.	MissingData
In the second study, we had no data on patient behaviour if they had had physical activity during the study period (11% of patients had received exercise, or the sedative equivalent of a medicine).	MissingData
Another limitation of our study was the high number of participants with no phone number.	MissingData
Another limitation of our study is the significant elapsed time (with respect to the number of participants per follow-up) that would not correspond to the number of follow-up visits by subjects who chose to participate in the trial.	MissingData
Unfortunately, these studies did not include all of the daily doses of sodium and potassium (although there was a positive trend in the number of patients with potassium in the upper range).	MissingData
An additional limitation is the loss of interest among some participants after completion of the intervention.	MissingData
Another limitation is that we did not collect baseline measurements for all the patient outcomes after randomisation.	MissingData
However, the fact that only 13 patients from the NCI cohort attended a phlebotomy was not surprising, although the impact of an additional phlebotomy on overall survival may have been less.	MissingData
In addition, there was a high rate of non-recognition of the symptomatic depression in patients after the last dose of TTC.	MissingData
Nevertheless, we missed out on 28% of study participants who had completed the clinically relevant studies with a corresponding average of 7 hrs of sleep a night, and had also discontinued the study on 6 occasions.	MissingData
We did not have data on patients' responses to blood tests, but collected only a small number of vital signs.	MissingData
The most significant finding of the current trial was the significant dropout rate from all of the arms.	MissingData
Further, we did not record any additional clinical variables for patients with severe hypertension, but this may have been due to the limited number of participants with severe hypertension, who were not able to participate in the cohort.	MissingData
Second, we could not obtain any dietary records to assess the nutritional status of patients.	MissingData
At least half of the trial participants dropped out of the study and the trial was discontinued after 28 weeks.	MissingData
We were unable to obtain complete clinical information in every subgroup for at least 10 years in the ACP study.	MissingData
The study was stopped at two of the three n-tier study sites, with a further decrease of about 89% in patients who dropped out of the trial (Figure 2).	MissingData
Although the study data in this cohort were available, we did not obtain detailed information on how participants responded to the questionnaire.	MissingData
At the end of the trial, we surveyed both treatment groups to determine if they had discontinued study participation and, where appropriate, measured duration of study participation.	MissingData
An issue with the study design is the lack of complete information on dietary intakes of patients.	MissingData
The absence of any patient follow-ups in the DAS trials is particularly striking, and in particular as the proportion of enrolled patients who had a complete visit to the hospital and did not participate in the DAS trial was slightly higher.	MissingData
Our sample size is small (>300 participants) and there was no corresponding response rate.	MissingData
In the second arm, only 16 % of patients reached endpoints of follow-up (from patients who were out of the study) for follow-up.	MissingData
We had limited information on clinical outcomes in our second cohort.	MissingData
In addition to the total number of participants in each of the three study arms who did not complete their participation, additional variables which are missing in our meta-analysis, are available.	MissingData
This limitation was only attributed to the relatively small number of patients that were not selected for the intervention.	MissingData
In the second cohort, the number of enrolments for the other two arm cohorts was small and the data were mainly based on enrolment history.	MissingData
In addition, data on the type of hydration was not available for most of our patients after the treatment of malaria in the saline arm.	MissingData
Our clinical trial was incomplete, owing to the limitation of our memory of participants with symptoms (e.g.	MissingData
Although we were unable to obtain information on total patient intake and daily rate of exercise, we were not able to assess glycemic thresholds or baseline levels.	MissingData
Firstly, we did not know whether participants remained neutral or did not accept the findings, and it was possible that participants reacted negatively to the findings in the second-half of the study (i.e., blinding was not performed).	Blinding
Furthermore, since we did not blind participants to the treatment, the effects of a third intervention could have been significant, which would explain the high proportion of participants who reported positive changes in body mass index (BMI).	Blinding
In addition, there could be a potential bias when one participant is unaware that another has been employed.	Blinding
In this study we did not observe any corresponding difference in patient behaviour at each site between the two groups and were therefore unable to identify which group was unblinded.	Blinding
Because of the open nature of the instrument and an important role for the centre in monitoring the symptomatology of patients with BP, a possible influencing factor on the outcome of this study is the number of patients that receive BP injections, which is expected to have led to unanticipated increases in the number of BP.	Blinding
The participants were unblinded to their intervention, which could explain why they might be more motivated to receive it, especially in the setting of clinical trials.	Blinding
Secondly, patients may have been unblinded by the clinicians who provided the training.	Blinding
The clinicians were not blinded to their intervention team but it was possible that the patients were not blind to their intervention, which explains why blinding was not possible.	Blinding
Consequently, the results from a follow-up study, which was not blinded, may have been slightly different from those reported from the primary study.	Blinding
It is possible that participants with unblinded arms will have experienced bias during the administration of the intervention or be unaware of this fact.	Blinding
One explanation for this is that participants did not report the level of their unblinding during the clinical session.	Blinding
Finally, a patient-assisted intervention would have increased self-administered treatment time, so this intervention may have been somewhat unblinded (as it is not a typical operative intervention).	Blinding
As a result, patient blinding to intervention could be impossible.	Blinding
We were not blinded to the outcomes but the intention of this was to assess whether participants were not aware of their assessment.	Blinding
In the case of an unblinded intervention, the researchers may have not been blind to the outcome outcome, so that it may be difficult to determine whether the intervention was blind or unblinded.	Blinding
Second, participants in this trial tended to be more positively manipulated than those in the main study, and this led to significant confounding effect.	Blinding
We cannot rule out the possibility that participants were unblinded when they delivered the resuscitation, but the effects of time on the final score were not apparent.	Blinding
Although the study was anonymous, we cannot exclude that the study participants were 'unblinded' by the radial arm.	Blinding
A blinded study would have aimed to limit the effect of self-involvement on the outcome.	Blinding
Because participants were blinded, it was not surprising that we could not distinguish patients who received the PIM from those who did not, and this was explained by the lack of blinding.	Blinding
First, patients may have been influenced by the decision to provide an anonymous or self-assessed session.	Blinding
The present study did not include a dose blinding procedure or a blinding protocol, so we cannot assume that patients were blinded to the use of the intervention.	Blinding
In addition, the decision-making process at this point hasn't yet been fully standardized.	Blinding
Given that the participants were blinded to which treatment they received, the study would not have been as important in determining whether or not participants had received the same treatment.	Blinding
Although the participants were not blinded to receive the injections, some patients were blinded to receive the interventions.	Blinding
The bias is greater in the case of treatment sessions incorporating both patients and volunteers with intracranial pressure.	Blinding
In this setting, it is difficult to determine whether or not patients were blinded to the intervention, but it may have been possible to detect some hidden bias.	Blinding
Perhaps a more direct measurement of participant perceptions is needed, as the study was performed by two investigators, whose responses may be unblinded by the administration of the standardised medication.	Blinding
A patient whose intervention group was not blinded would be required to recognise who received the intervention, which accounted for a significant proportion of all participant bias.	Blinding
A potential source of bias would be the ensuing interobserver or evaluator confusion when the two teams were matched on baseline behavioural behaviour, thus raising the potential for a double-blind design.	Blinding
A potential limitation of the study is the absence of biochemical measurements of bone mineral density and bone mineral concentration (n = 3) in the patients after surgery.	MissingData
The clinical relevance of our intervention is limited, but we found some limitations and we concluded that we did not adequately evaluate our prospective design.	MissingData
Additionally, it is surprising that the number of deaths caused by the infection remained consistent for two of the three arm-experiments.	MissingData
The limitations of the randomized trial approach are greater due to the large number of patients in the study who opted to leave the study.	MissingData
Our study was mostly conducted at home.	MissingData
It is of interest that a similar proportion of participants were removed from the ivg study.	MissingData
In addition, we could not independently assess the effect of treatment and treatment-related factors on triglycerides at follow-up.	MissingData
Because of the limited number of participants in the trial, we could not obtain detailed clinical outcomes or even assessment of the patient's functional responses to the intervention.	MissingData
Another limitation of this study was our failure to collect the primary outcome variables – body weight, body temperature, pulse rate, and urine pressure (DI) in the B-group and the D-group, in comparison to the other interventions, which were in the b-group.	MissingData
Notably, the study included patients who were unable to take part in the behavioural-response interview and which were not able to contribute to a meaningful statistical analysis of disease severity.	MissingData
Our data could be biased toward a single treatment arm, in which the patients were recruited from 3 randomization arms, causing substantial bias to our analysis.	MissingData
As the symptom of a drug-related adverse event, clinical outcome may have been determined only by hemoglobin measurements.	MissingData
As one of the conditions that influenced our decision-making, the number of participants not completing the study was high.	MissingData
However, we had difficulty retrieving information about any of the patient enrolled in either intervention, and therefore cannot be completely sure of the number of participants enrolled in the intervention.	MissingData
Finally, it is possible that missing data could be related to insufficient medical assessment.	MissingData
This limitation of the study is further complicated by the limitation of the physicochemical assessment of B.C. to.	MissingData
Another limitation was the small number of patients who had to stop or start the course of neoadjuvant treatment despite a desire to be enrolled for follow-up.	MissingData
In addition, our patient pool data was unable to capture the volume of daily intake of participants in the two arms of the study.	MissingData
Although we had limited information on a few subjects in the trial, the overall sample size of 83 had a large effect on our interpretation of outcome, and we therefore could not conclude how the ominous toxicity of the study might have affected the outcome in this study.	MissingData
The nature of the randomisation scheme entails some biases in patients’ willingness to participate, but this is not significant.	MissingData
Our missing data in our second and third groups may have been more pronounced in the third group than in our first group.	MissingData
The study did not provide information on the rate of onset of illness during clinical follow-up.	MissingData
First, there were no follow-ups to a second group of women enrolled in the study.	MissingData
Firstly, not all participants reached their follow-up visits and they were not collected from the follow-up telephone.	MissingData
This limitation is probably because we did not acquire enough information from the patients that could be used for assessing the effect of treatment on behavioural outcome, including bowel acidification.	MissingData
We were unable to obtain further data for all participants in the BCA cohort in the BCA-BAT study.	MissingData
First, there are no observations from study members of the second-arm arm, thus some variation in outcomes and effect sizes might have occurred.	MissingData
In this study, the number of patients in the placebo group dropped by 97% compared to a group of patients in the intervention group.	MissingData
Moreover, there was a significant number of participants who did not complete the DSC, the ELISA questionnaire, and the EDSA phone calls.	MissingData
Further, in most cases patients were not enrolled in the study, indicating a greater fear of detriment in clinical outcomes in the intervention.	MissingData
However, although some of the vascular outcomes and BP could be evaluated, we could not obtain a detailed assessment of these outcomes.	MissingData
Because we could not obtain blood pressure measurements at the end of the study, there is a high proportion of dropouts due to medical reasons.	MissingData
In addition to baseline glucose data, only 24-hr glucose level recorded by participants was available for some of our intervention groups.	MissingData
However, we lacked adequate statistical analyses and had no record of dietary intake for the two studies that we discontinued.	MissingData
Unfortunately, because of a lack of participation in the study, participants were unable to participate in the reanalysis.	MissingData
The relatively high proportion of missing data during follow-up in the two intervention arms (n=112) is due to a lack of a formal data record.	MissingData
A limitation of our study was that our study did not collect the resuscitation time.	MissingData
A number of participants were absent from follow-up and/or the second trial had more than 51% (see below).	MissingData
A limitation of the study was the limited availability of blood and pulmonary blood samples after intervention.	MissingData
Moreover, we were unable to collect information on the impact of dietary and/or social factors on socio-economic status.	MissingData
In addition, patients did not provide complete clinical and endocrine histories, albeit very small, of patients with mild to moderate chronic bronchitis.	MissingData
Moreover, in the follow-up analyses only two participants were available with detailed assessment of their weight and physiology, but this was not accounted for in the final analysis.	MissingData
Further, the low level of follow-up in this study, despite the inclusion of a follow-up questionnaire, resulted in poor clinical outcome.	MissingData
As a consequence, the analysis of laboratory systolic blood pressure is insufficient to provide a reliable estimate of the effects of exercise on blood pressure, and this effect may also be explained by the small number of participants (>1%).	MissingData
However, as the participants were not physically present at the end of the study, it is possible that some patients were missing vital signs after treatment with chloroform.	MissingData
A major limitation of this study is that it does not assess the efficacy of the aforementioned method of treatment and therefore cannot be generalized.	Generalization
Therefore, it is important to consider whether the results can be interpreted in the context of this study.	Generalization
The results of this study have a constrictive effect on the extension of the current findings in the fag population.	Generalization
Thirdly, the results may be interpreted only in a very limited context.	Generalization
The results of our study can only be generalized to patients with a more complex medical condition, and therefore cannot be generalized to patients with more severe medical conditions or severe pain.	Generalization
A significant limitation of the present study is its ability to apply the results to patients with BCG 3 mm in general and its lack of generalisation to adults with BCG 3 mm in particular.	Generalization
First, a generalisation may be needed in the future, as our results are limited to the patients in the study and therefore not applicable to all patients.	Generalization
Finally, the findings are limited in their generalisability to other population studies in which we tested participants with the same or similar disease.	Generalization
This study cannot be used in an environment where patients receiving DME cannot be compared with the LMS.	Generalization
Hence, our findings may not be generalizable to the larger number of persons with DVR in our cohort.	Generalization
Finally, the data from our study could not be extrapolated to other conditions.	Generalization
Therefore, because our model was performed on a small sample of patients with osteoarthritis, our results cannot be compared with findings of other studies.	Generalization
The results obtained in this study have been reported by individuals with less advanced cardiovascular disease, but their generalizability to other conditions is questionable.	Generalization
Our results apply to clinical trials at different settings, with patients with asymptomatic leukemia and patients with chronic pain and diabetes.	Generalization
However, our study is only applicable to patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, and this study is specific to adult patients who have advanced cardiovascular disease.	Generalization
Its short duration and low level of support for weight loss would also limit our ability to assess the overall effect of weight loss on an individual's ability to achieve their goal.	StudyDuration
However, short term follow up was a limitation of this study because it may be difficult to quantify the effects of treatment on treatment cost and improve outcomes.	StudyDuration
In this study, our primary observational data is from the following three months, which was not long enough to explore the effect of Xanax on early bone loss.	StudyDuration
Second, there was no duration of follow-up period to measure the effects of anticonvulsants on risk factors for clogged arteries.	StudyDuration
Firstly, this trial does not take a long time to complete, allowing an extension of the clinical experience.	StudyDuration
The short duration of the trial did not allow for the comparison between placebo and the longer term effects of a healthy diet and supplements in the short term.	StudyDuration
The shorter duration would be helpful in identifying mechanisms of improvement and was therefore not possible to assess whether this effect was ascribed to placebo or to treatment failure.	StudyDuration
One limitation of the study was the short follow-up period.	StudyDuration
First, it would be prudent to consider the possibility of a prolonged follow-up for long-term follow-up of the effects of zinc implantation on erectile function in these patients.	StudyDuration
This observational study only lasted three months, but the subsequent results suggest that a longer time frame may be needed for an effective treatment of metastatic cancer.	StudyDuration
The short study duration is problematic, as the first and longest treatment periods are short and the effect of the treatment modality on the total effect is not apparent at 1 year post treatment.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, due to the nature of the condition and the nature of the problem, we could not define a longer-term follow-up period for the ED.	StudyDuration
Second, it is difficult to assess the effect of oral antidepressants during long-term follow-up because we only evaluated the effect of oral antidepressants for 12 months.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, although the benefit of DHA would be evident in long-term follow-up, only 2 years of follow-up is available at the time of publication, which would be a longer period of time than is envisaged for longitudinal studies.	StudyDuration
Third, due to the long duration of treatment and the toxicity of metformin the effect is not fully established at the long term.	StudyDuration
Although a placebo was used, the findings that could be derived from a lack of efficacy by either side are inconsistent.	Control
Because neither the active nor inactive arms were being used it would be difficult to determine the effect of adding or removing doses and to assess the pharmacokinetics of the active arms of different types of therapy.	Control
In the current study, we did not include a control arm, so there was no control arm in ICB or GRB.	Control
Neither of the arms of the study enrolled a control arm i.e. neither of the arms were given any therapy.	Control
This approach was chosen because the two arms were not randomized and therefore neither treatment was adequate to assess the impact of the study.	Control
The randomised controlled trial was also used to examine the effects of either group of participants on the effect of weight loss.	Control
It was not planned to use a control group as this is what we did with the placebo arm in the nEUR-R study, with the aim of having a placebo arm with more active participants.	Control
Therefore, it was not necessary to include a control arm in this study because neither was available and a lack of control arm in this study did not preclude the use of the intervention in the group with less severe illness.	Control
In addition, the treatment group was not randomized and therefore did not include control groups in the study.	Control
We did not have a control group to determine whether the antitumor effect was present.	Control
The randomised controlled trial complemented this approach by combining the CNS with the CNS alone.	Control
As both arms of the study were not controlled by an active control, it was impossible for this study to test the effect of the control arm alone, as only one arm of each arm was used to determine the effect of the sedative intervention in this study.	Control
As the control group had no control effects on the active components of the drug in DR a treatment of DR had a greater incidence of DR.	Control
In addition, our control arm had been selected due to a lack of suitable antimicrobial drugs in the study and it did not have any placebo treatment.	Control
Because the study was conducted in an open group (no control group), no control was available which demonstrated that it was appropriate for controlling any aspect of the disease.	Control
Although we were unable to collect blood glucose measurements from the study participants, the sensitivity of these measures is well beyond the sensitivity ranges in the study.	MissingData
A potential limitation of our study design was that we could not get baseline blood pressure data, indicating a relatively small number of patients who did not complete the whole study.	MissingData
Our follow-up was essentially limited to the morning, tee-time and resting time at the home computer, although we did obtain a number of essential data at the end of the study.	MissingData
It is also interesting that some resuscitation is reported among patients whose first-line blood pressure was above 220 C and blood pressure in a normal setting was above 220 C, although this was not a concern in most participants, probably due to the possibility of mistreatment or because of a lack of follow-up.	MissingData
An example of missed data would be the absence of laboratory data on bone mineral density and body surface area.	MissingData
We could not confirm that the presence of recurrent heart attacks in the ELISA study was related to any underlying symptoms.	MissingData
Several missing values are due to the small number of participants.	MissingData
The limitations of our cohort study are apparent and may have contributed to the small number of participants left behind, in particular because of high level of physical activity.	MissingData
We were unable to collect a total of 69.1% of all patients.	MissingData
Additionally, we were unable to identify any significant effect of adolescent smoking on the daily weight gain, but did not have an explanation for this.	MissingData
As an interesting limitation to the study we did not collect data on the treatment of patients with acute infection during the follow-up period.	MissingData
Another limitation was that participants who discontinued the study after 24 months were not eligible to participate in the analysis, which would have increased the possibility of a bias in some outcome measures.	MissingData
A significant limitation of the trial was the loss of physical fitness data on participants in all groups.	MissingData
Because of the nature of the intervention, the proportion of patients who gave up the study is smaller.	MissingData
We were unable to obtain a detailed assessment of pulmonary function from the clinical and resuscitation assessments at week 4 after the trial.	MissingData
Although a more stable study duration is necessary to fully understand the effects of cisplatin on long-term bone loss, short term studies are not adequate for studying long-term disease progression.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, although the duration of the trial was short, it was clear that the clinical effect might last for more than 6 months after onset of the disease, whereas the effect of treatment effect may last longer.	StudyDuration
Perhaps the most important finding of the study is that both longer duration and shorter duration of treatment might be relevant, given the impact of the CTCs on patient health.	StudyDuration
The 8-week follow-up time could be extended to 6 months after the onset of symptoms but is short for long-term evaluation.	StudyDuration
Additionally, the short duration of the treatment trial would limit the clinical evaluation of the treatment efficacy in predicting the outcome of subsequent studies.	StudyDuration
However, we were not able to follow up on the findings of this study beyond 12 months, as our results could not be followed with any serious adverse effects.	StudyDuration
In this study, a shorter duration would be required to evaluate the long-term impact of DMD on a potential mechanism of action for treatment.	StudyDuration
Third, a longer follow-up time is required to establish treatment efficacy, particularly in patients with high body weight.	StudyDuration
Secondly, it would be beneficial to have an extension of the follow-up period at the end of the study to determine the impact of treatment regimens.	StudyDuration
Third, this effect might only be seen for 2 or 3 years, however it is possible that this was to make it possible to predict treatment outcome in a longer term.	StudyDuration
A longer trial time would be needed to evaluate the effect of BMD on a neuroprotective effect.	StudyDuration
The duration of our study was short, giving us an understanding of the therapeutic response.	StudyDuration
Secondly, we were not able to determine the long-term treatment effect of statins on patients with acute peptic ulcers, as this could influence their ability to treat chronic pain, exacerbate symptoms, or improve function.	StudyDuration
Although not published in any published studies, we conclude that the findings would be most relevant after one year of follow-up, but have more influence on our understanding of the benefits of oral nutritional supplementation over erectile dysfunction.	StudyDuration
Secondly, in the absence of follow-up, it was not possible to establish a long-term trend in the effectiveness of treatment.	StudyDuration
An interesting theoretical limitation is that it may be difficult to establish whether participants were blinded to treatment outcomes by an interviewer (i.e., the interviewer did not give the intervention to all participants) or if it is unclear whether participants were blinded to study outcomes.	Blinding
As expected, there was some crossover between the groups with an interventionist and a clinician with an injector, but no true blinding to the injector was observed, which could be explained by the presence of a non-diamondal asymmetrical or concentric loop.	Blinding
Second, our data are not blinded, and the study was not blinded.	Blinding
Possibly, an individual had to be blinded by participants to their own intervention.	Blinding
Because the two studies were conducted by two investigators, it was possible that some participants were not blinded.	Blinding
An attempt to avoid self-regulatory effect (or lack of bias) might have been attempted in this study, but the result of this study was unclear.	Blinding
If we expect patients to be unblinded to the intervention, we can anticipate a variation in patient characteristics, but the study is not blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
Alternatively, the participants were not blinded, so it would be difficult to ascertain the impact of blinding on the outcomes.	Blinding
The use of a placebo should not be interpreted as a form of self-blinding and it is conceivable that patients might have misinterpreted the results of the interventions, or have experienced misinformation due to non-use of the drug.	Blinding
However, the clinical interviewer may have been unblinded and the physiotherapy interventions were not blinded.	Blinding
The absence of blinding to medication management was not necessary to eliminate the possibility that this intervention may have influenced participants’ subsequent treatment decisions.	Blinding
The practice was randomized into the intervention group by randomisation agents.	Blinding
If this was not the case, the study staff could not have detected any patients as being unblinded, as some patients may have remained unblinded after receiving the intervention (Fig. 5).	Blinding
In a randomized trial, patients may have been blinded to participant status (e.g., blinded to treatment results).	Blinding
Some participants may have viewed the study as blinded by their physicians, thereby exposing them to the full extent of the study and increasing the potential for bias.	Blinding
Furthermore, we had a no-covariate model to control for all covariates and we re-analyzed all of these variables; therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
The multiple correlation analysis (MOR) analysis suggests a sensitivity of our results to psychosocial factors such as sleep disruption and diet.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, we did not make additional tests for other risk factors for obesity.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, we analyzed multiple risk factors for mortality.	StatisticalAnalysis
Another limitation is the multiple comparison model in which we compared different outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Third, although our results were based on multiple assessments of a number of variables, we didn't expect to collect all possible outcomes from all studies.	StatisticalAnalysis
Given that we controlled for multiple measures of anxiety, a factor of depression, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and phobias could have contributed to these findings.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, our multiple outcomes analysis could have introduced biases in our calculations.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, although we compared the outcomes of the outcomes tests, there was significant interaction among the three variables that led to the conclusion that these two groups were independent, and there might be some unintended consequences from this.	StatisticalAnalysis
Furthermore, we examined multiple outcomes, which could explain the difference in weight between the two groups.	StatisticalAnalysis
Therefore, the primary and secondary analyses were not statistically significant, but still significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Therefore, we had several tests on CRT to assess whether a factor played a role in improving the quality of life and improving psychological well-being among the participants.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, there were no interaction analyses; as a result, the results might have been influenced by various factors, including clinical factors, psychological factors, and economic factors.	StatisticalAnalysis
Third, our primary hypothesis was non-significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, our randomised trial design allows for multiple assessments of risk factors.	StatisticalAnalysis
Another limitation of our study was the relatively high proportion of patients missing vital signs at baseline, resulting from the lower response rate to serum markers after each study session.	MissingData
Another limitation of our study was that we had no additional information on participants' gender at baseline.	MissingData
The absence of objective measurement of lipid profile and glucose absorbed was a limitation, as serum glucose was not analyzed.	MissingData
Finally, a lack of follow-up assessment (i.e. absence of follow-up is probably due to the lack of time to response) in the intervention group made it difficult to interpret how this impact on the clinical outcome and could have contributed to the limitations in the final report.	MissingData
The absence of response data in patients was particularly pronounced and compared with patients in the second study.	MissingData
A second limitation of the study was the high number of patients that were not enrolled in both studies.	MissingData
The smallest cohort of non-participants in the ABG trial was the one with greater age and body mass index (BMI), and this was related to low number of blood glucose levels (>50 mm Hg) and short duration of treatment.	MissingData
Further, we did not have a questionnaire assessing the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is associated with a greater tendency to persist among patients in the study.	MissingData
Because we were not able to obtain a complete physical examination, it was difficult to make a complete assessment of the effects of diet on occlusion.	MissingData
We have no clinically relevant data from patients who completed both randomized arm of the study.	MissingData
The symmetric parameters measured during the trial were the same in all studies, and therefore not possible to determine causal relationships with patient outcomes.	MissingData
The large numbers of participants in the eSCHOOL trial are reflected in the lower response rate.	MissingData
We also had no contact data for any of the patients, and the information we had on these patients was incomplete, perhaps due to the varying duration of stay, the nature of work involved and the lack of follow up information.	MissingData
Second, the study remained a closed trial with a total of 886 participants.	MissingData
Finally, no pharmacokinetics data were collected from 68 patients, suggesting that some of the adverse effects of dna treatment may have been due to a high proportion of patients being treated with dna treatment in this trial.	MissingData
This limitation of our study may reflect differences in underlying motivations and factors contributing to the dropout in the 2 groups.	MissingData
This reflects the limitation of our data collection.	MissingData
Finally, patient responses to physiotherapy were not tracked with the aim of determining underlying cause.	MissingData
First, we did not follow up more than 50 patients who had completed their baseline assessments at one follow-up visit.	MissingData
Although the data were available for 62.2% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CHD), only 62.5% of patients were available for cardiac pharmacokinetics.	MissingData
We did not have the opportunity to observe or assess the incidence of adolescent relapse in any randomized trial.	MissingData
In addition, our ability to obtain blood pressure and glucose values has been limited by the limited amount of laboratory and pathological data collected.	MissingData
The small number of patients who abandoned the study and/or refused to complete any of the assessments was not expected to be limited to a cohort of 20 patients.	MissingData
Although missing data of at least three subjects, it was observed that some of these patients had an increased number of hours of physical activity.	MissingData
There is no direct correlation between laboratory data collection and dietary intake in both groups.	MissingData
Second, only three out of six subjects did not receive blood samples, suggesting that we did not have sufficient information to evaluate the efficacy of oral contraceptives or the use of acupuncture to treat migraine.	MissingData
The nature of this trial might have contributed to the lack of data for adherence or even adherence status.	MissingData
Our trial was limited to the two trials with data collected only at day 2 of the study.	MissingData
Secondly, in the secondary outcome analysis, only 31% of the patients were followed up after two clinical trials, while 72% were.	MissingData
Second, because there were fewer participants in the study than in the other trials, it was particularly difficult to identify causal mechanisms at play.	MissingData
The clinicians may have used a blinding strategy to assess whether intervention outcomes were the same or different.	Blinding
Therefore, it is unclear whether the participants were blinded to the outcome measure.	Blinding
Neither the participants nor their assistants blinded themselves to the use of the intervention, nor was the intervention blinded to participants receiving the intervention.	Blinding
Therefore, it is unlikely that the participants were blinded by the consultant in this study, as the participants could not have known their participants' baseline health status.	Blinding
The intervention protocols had been carefully screened to ensure the effectiveness of the intervention.	Blinding
An attempt to blind the data could be useful, but there is no evidence of patient blinding.	Blinding
Furthermore, because a secondary outcome was obtained from both groups, it was possible that there was no blinding.	Blinding
The blindedness effect of a blinded study, as shown by participants and providers, was partly due to the nature of the intervention and to potential variation in the outcomes across treatment arm variables.	Blinding
In addition, because of the absence of a blinding device, it is not known whether participants were blinded to either intervention or to study behaviours in the CPSA.	Blinding
However, when patients returned home for visit after the visit, participants could have remained unaware of their intervention.	Blinding
A more systematic approach to selecting treatment interventions could be more effective.	Blinding
Second, it could be assumed that blindedness was an important consideration in selecting treatment for patients.	Blinding
A patient may not have known which intervention was taking place by reading the participants' remuneration cards in a particular room.	Blinding
First, a number of participants may have been unblinded, but it is unclear whether these patients were blinded to receive the different treatments.	Blinding
Another potential reason for this is that it is conceivable that participants have not been blinded to the outcome of the intervention.	Blinding
Finally, our underlying model does not support our hypothesis of causality.	StatisticalAnalysis
Furthermore, we performed multilevel analysis, which is not standard for our study and could introduce an error of 1 in interpretation.	StatisticalAnalysis
The higher statistical threshold may have caused us to limit our analyses to one-way interactions with other covariates.	StatisticalAnalysis
This method of analysis utilised two multiple tests (one test for depression and one for anxiety) and there was a loss of covariates among our tests, which might account for some of the significant differences in mortality resulting from Alzheimer's disease.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, we tested several mechanisms and had multiple outcomes, including clinical and socioeconomic factors, which may have influenced the outcome.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, our multiple regression model is not robust enough to account for other possible outcomes, which might account for the variation between the analyses.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we adjusted our test size to 5% for all outcomes, one of the outcomes we had to adjust for was age.	StatisticalAnalysis
The significance of our exploratory analysis test may be diminished because we left out other important outcomes in our analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, as we assessed all the effects of each intervention separately, it might be possible to exclude additional interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, because we did not control for confounding variables, if multiple outcomes were present in the analysis, this is due to the nature of our statistical model.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, we had multiple tests of G-protein interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, although we performed a number of multiple analysis procedures, no association between the variables was made.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, we analyzed multiple variables for each hypothesis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, because we performed multiple logistic regression analyses, we could not test for multiple significant interactions between variables.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, our multiple outcome analysis approach is not optimal because we still adjusted for multiple factors that can influence CVD and CGM.	StatisticalAnalysis
The control of this trial included a placebo arm with no active drug, meaning that a small number of healthy control arm patients received an active drug (n=37).	Control
The use of a control arm gave us a better control effect as we are less likely to have had the benefits of a placebo arm.	Control
Having only a single active treatment (no placebo) in the trial would have had less effect than using a standard of care control, but neither treatment had substantial effects on the effects of oral antibiotics, which are commonly used as adjunctive treatments to prevent stroke, because of the small size of the treatment area and in the lack of a comparator arm.	Control
Having an active control arm to compare results with would have been more helpful in the comparison of a more active control with active treatment.	Control
Therefore, a control group did not receive the full benefit of the effect of the control trial.	Control
Compared to another control, the dose of cGMD was compared to placebo.	Control
If the treatment had been administered in a placebo group, it might have prevented some of the effects noted in the present study.	Control
Furthermore, in the absence of a placebo treatment group, our results indicate that the inclusion of a placebo group does not have an adverse effect on the effect of phytochrome serotype in these trials.	Control
As a control, we could not compare the results of NAVOC with those of placebo alone.	Control
Thus, no treatment control was included.	Control
As our study was not a control group, neither group received the stimulation of a placebo arm in comparison to a control arm.	Control
If the control intervention had been used instead of a regular exercise program, it would have had less adverse effects than a standard control.	Control
The lack of a control was due to a lack of control intervention in this trial, which included both the neonatal care group (which is more commonly known as neonatal care) and the neonatal care group (which was not previously available to the international community) in order to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.	Control
As such, it is not clear whether our experimental group would have performed as well with a placebo group or in a placebo group.	Control
Compared with a placebo group, neither randomized trial could represent a full treatment arm of LTBP, and hence the absence of a randomized control in this study is not explained by the smaller sample size.	Control
Therefore, the findings in this study may not be generalisable to individuals in other settings.	Generalization
First, the results can only be applied to patients who had vascular disease referred for an emergency department visit.	Generalization
Thus, our results are applicable only to patients with the upper extremity of head who presented with a torso fracture.	Generalization
First, the results of our study were conducted on participants with mild or moderately severe mental illness.	Generalization
The results of the study are unique because their clinical effects may differ, and we have limited experience with these types of sleeve-drug-based approaches.	Generalization
This may limit the generalisation of our findings to the general population, since the findings may not be generalizable to other settings.	Generalization
Consequently, it is necessary to consider how this finding is generalizable to other patients who are taking care of the patient referred to the center for the treatment of osteoarthritis in adulthood.	Generalization
The results of our study may not be generalizable to patients who are not medically assessed with a vascular stenting device or in other medically complex situations.	Generalization
This limits the possibility of extrapolating our findings to the general population.	Generalization
A supplementary study with similar findings from the NIMH-HCA toxicity trials could lead to an interpretation of the results.	Generalization
The results of the present study may not have generalized across other types of breast cancer, such as bone marrow transplantation.	Generalization
Our findings could not be extrapolated to patients whose heart rate was not the same as normal over the course of the day.	Generalization
However, the findings may not be applicable to persons in whom acupuncture therapy is available elsewhere in the world, especially if the acupuncture treatment is administered at a higher dose.	Generalization
The study is specific to our current study, but is not generalizable to other patients.	Generalization
The results of this study may not apply to patients with a common cardiovascular risk condition (e.g.	Generalization
Second, the study did not include all participants with asymptomatic diabetes mellitus, which may have contributed to some of the sedation effects.	MissingData
As noted above, we could not assess whether patients in the 2nd arm in the trial were registered to participate.	MissingData
An additional limitation of the study is the large number of patients not being registered with the phone lines.	MissingData
Moreover, our observational data on all subjects are short and infrequent, highlighting the limitations of the study.	MissingData
Finally, there were significant differences in the overall study response, mainly due to differences in physical activity and physical activity.	MissingData
We are at a significant disadvantage in our inability to obtain laboratory information for a number of patients that we had previously investigated, namely the number of participants who were at risk of developing cardiovascular disease or pulmonary hypertension.	MissingData
Given the low numbers of participants in the DKD and OMG, this a limitation of the study.	MissingData
An additional limitation is that although we did collect data from 18 patients in the DRG arm of the BIC trial, we were not able to obtain data on the distribution of BMI.	MissingData
First, patients who stopped the study were not asked to attend a follow-up visit.	MissingData
One reason for this is the small number of patients who did not complete the questionnaires on their own.	MissingData
Given the high loss-to-treatment and the low-turnover rate, it is difficult to calculate the proportion of patients with severe depression, who have been unable to follow up, or to return to the study on any given day.	MissingData
Our sample size is very small and is a reflection of the asymmetry of the sample size.	MissingData
First, some of the study’s participants did not respond to questionnaires for patient satisfaction or for psychological measures.	MissingData
We are also concerned by the small number of participants who were not able to participate in both arms of the study.	MissingData
It is also significant that we did not obtain information on weight gain in all groups.	MissingData
The study data were not blinded.	Blinding
It would have been reasonable for participants to know the baseline characteristics of the evaluators before they commenced, but it is unlikely that the evaluators were blinded by the investigators.	Blinding
The participants were blinded to participants' intentions.	Blinding
The participant control group was unblinded to the treatment of patients receiving either of the two experimental groups in the cohort, thereby avoiding the possibility of any intervention bias.	Blinding
In an emergency, an investigator could not blind his or her participants to the treatment plan and may have left these patients uninformed about treatment.	Blinding
This may have been prevented by participants blinding themselves to the participants' treatment at the end of the study.	Blinding
During the trial, the HCMV study team may have deliberately excluded participants with a significant number of CHDs (see subsection 2.7).	Blinding
In addition, the authors wished to control for potential blinding by their participants.	Blinding
A confounder bias occurs when an individual participant has experienced a significant decrease in self-efficacy resulting from the administration of the intervention compared with that experienced by patients using the more simple injection protocol.	Blinding
In addition, some of the participants were randomized to each intervention, so it is possible that participants were not blinded to each intervention.	Blinding
A double-blind study was performed, and when participants were unaware of the intervention, this could result in a potential mis-recording and bias (Meyer et al.	Blinding
Because of the nature of a blinded approach to the assessment, it may be possible for participants to be unblinded to the outcome variables chosen for the study.	Blinding
A variation in treatment allocation in a clinical practice group could result from participant-led intervention changes or a selection bias.	Blinding
The absence of a placebo in the treatment and subsequent post-treatment follow-up meant that participants were not blinded to the results of the two trials.	Blinding
In the absence of a study manager blinding, the use of a matched control group (i.e., the non-blinded control group) could not be totally eliminated.	Blinding
In addition, the findings of this study may not be generalisable to participants from other countries.	Generalization
Thus, it is important that this study be transferred to other patients with chronic kidney disease.	Generalization
This means that our results might not be generalisable to other phlebotomy care centers in the U.S.	Generalization
Consequently, our findings were restricted to patients with chronic nephritis and it is possible that our findings may not be generalizable to patients with more chronic nephritic conditions.	Generalization
Moreover, our results are not generalizable to other studies with similar outcomes, thus we cannot assume that the findings of the study with the eMDS were generalizable to other studies.	Generalization
However, the generalisability of our findings is limited because the EDAE results are specific to EDAE study participants, but not to non-diabetic patients.	Generalization
Hence, the results may not apply to other studies on the same population.	Generalization
This may limit the generalizability of the findings to patients with non-epilepsy, especially in the context of the aforementioned research.	Generalization
Second, as this study is only applicable in the U.S.A., its generalisation is limited.	Generalization
Therefore, the results of this study cannot be generalized to the full spectrum of cardiovascular disease.	Generalization
This means that the results may be generalizable only to patients with BP, but not to other patients with BP who have BP associated with BP.	Generalization
This may limit the interpretation of the results with respect to non-surgeons, who may not have had adequate exposure to the drug in the previous weeks or months.	Generalization
Thus, the results of our study are specific to the septicemia in which the patient had a stroke.	Generalization
This limitation can lead to a limitation in generalizability to participants with lower MCS with less significant comorbidities.	Generalization
This is due to limitations in extending the results from the ionizing radiation treatment to a larger population.	Generalization
Cross-over designs are difficult to implement because of the limited number of sites and the need to analyze all data after post-hoc adjustment.	StudyDesign
However, this trial was a pilot effort.	StudyDesign
The study design was a bit challenging in determining the optimal randomized intervention; this was partly because we were interested in a more pragmatic approach.	StudyDesign
An important study design limitation was the need to use a randomized design, despite a lower number of patients being enrolled and there is no need for any endpoint analyses.	StudyDesign
A multicenter study may have limitations.	StudyDesign
However, this small, open-label trial could be less suitable for large-scale implementations, and it is not possible to design a randomized design.	StudyDesign
Our intervention was an exploratory phase and we used a cluster design.	StudyDesign
This study was small in sample size, which enables us to test for confounders and to use baseline values as well as aggregated outcomes to assess the effect of intervention design.	StudyDesign
This study was conceived to assess a range of potential randomized controlled trials.	StudyDesign
First, the trial is not completely transparent.	StudyDesign
Third, while it would have been desirable to include a randomized control group in the study, the use of a non-randomized control group was not feasible.	StudyDesign
In addition, we used cluster-randomized design, which may have a small number of participants and therefore lower the possibility of future randomized control trials.	StudyDesign
Furthermore, these investigators did not make any formal design decisions because of the pragmatic nature of our study and the potential limitations to how we could manage the study.	StudyDesign
First, we used a pilot design and, while our data remained unaffected by the addition of other groups, we did not want to limit our study to just non-interventional groups.	StudyDesign
A limited number of participants were included in the study, but all of the data obtained in this study could be evaluated at the local level.	StudyDesign
In addition, only 3% of patients had the opportunity to complete the DSHC questionnaire and 53% had access to their complete medical history.	MissingData
In our study we were unable to obtain baseline weight changes for all patients after completion of one of the six treatments, which are reported at a later time point.	MissingData
Our study cohort was small, and therefore we were unable to examine erectile dysfunction and muscle wasting in patients with mild obstructive pulmonary disease (ME) who did not participate in the study.	MissingData
Our main limitation was that at least half of the study participants were not attending weekly follow-up appointments.	MissingData
The absence of an objective scale in the RTDA-SES study further complicates interpretation of the RRDA outcome, as in the absence of an objective measure of change in the serum progesterone level.	MissingData
However, we have identified approximately 4% of patients who lost the study, including the patients with acute and chronic neuropathic pain.	MissingData
This limitation is magnified by the nave attitude of many study participants towards the need to return to routine care after completion of treatment.	MissingData
A limitation of the study was the high number of patients who dropped out of the study due to either lack of motivation or a lack of motivation in the early days.	MissingData
Furthermore, we could not identify the syringe or implant worn by the participant.	MissingData
We had no detailed assessment of the health of participants in the PURE Study, and were unable to collect any vital biochemical or radiographic observations from patients during follow-up visits.	MissingData
As a consequence, we had no information on clinical outcomes (but did have information on dietary intake and physical activity).	MissingData
Further, the study did not capture a clinically meaningful number of observations.	MissingData
Second, it is unknown whether the effects of ivf on cutaneous inflammation can be observed in these patients, as this may have influenced the clinical outcome.	MissingData
Lastly, the small number of patients who opted out of the trial is particularly significant, as they were not always well served in clinical trial visits.	MissingData
To make final assessment of toxicity, we did not have an opportunity to ask about weight gain or glycemic load changes for these patients.	MissingData
Therefore, neither our controlled intervention nor the nonrandomized placebo arms were considered in the study.	Control
The fact that a placebo arm was used in the trial is less relevant since the intervention has been demonstrated to have less clinical value than an active arm.	Control
We could not have performed a controlled trial with either group as a control because neither group showed any benefit.	Control
The presence of a randomized control in this study shows that comparing two treatments with one another is not possible.	Control
Hence, neither the study design nor the control strategy was selected as a control to see whether the characteristics of this intervention were achieved or not.	Control
Neither the treatment in this study was a placebo control, thus limiting the effect of the ‘control’ intervention.	Control
Because this study was designed as a comparison between patients taking a medication and those taking a placebo, neither control was used in this study.	Control
This is due to the asymmetry of the two arms in the study.	Control
It may be that our control group did not receive the randomized dose of placebo to reduce the potential side effects that are attributed to the low quality of the treatment.	Control
Since no controls were given in this study, we did not know whether a double placebo was indicated in our trial in order to avoid a possible selection bias.	Control
In this study, neither of the two arms was given a control arm; however, I believe this may have resulted from a biased nature of the control arm.	Control
Furthermore, in contrast to the “control” group, which lacked the standard of care, there was no placebo group present in a study of the type of drug at a much higher dose, and thus lacked a control group that has the same treatment aims.	Control
In this experiment, the combination of the active and passive arms of the two arms of the randomized placebo controlled trial.	Control
Although we do not know how long it would take to achieve a normal physiological response in this study, we believe that if we took part in a more controlled intervention the clinical outcome would be different.	Control
Since neither group was active the trial was not randomized and only the active group was excluded.	Control
Finally, the duration of the clinical follow-up period of the study is too short to capture the full extent of the benefits of pharmacotherapy compared with other approaches.	StudyDuration
We did not include a time-to-effect curve for this type of study and this would be a concern for prospective studies, which would have a longer time frame for evaluation and addressing underlying mechanisms of disease.	StudyDuration
This was partly due to the short duration of the trial.	StudyDuration
First, the early termination of our study is not as convincing as we might wish, as only one of the two months after the onset of therapy may be sufficient to maintain changes in BMD.	StudyDuration
We also studied only the initial clinical course of osteoporosis and were not able to conclude the potential impact of a potential osteoporosis intervention over a longer time frame.	StudyDuration
A longer trial duration would be desirable, but it would be helpful to examine the long-term effects on the clinical outcome in a long-term setting, as well as the impact of ongoing therapy.	StudyDuration
One of the main limitations of this study was the need for long term follow-up despite positive early symptom reduction.	StudyDuration
Therefore, it may be necessary to conclude that the most relevant study duration should be one year as an objective to exclude the possibility of long-term benefit from oral chemotherapy (e.g.	StudyDuration
A later extension of the study may have prevented the elicitation of long-term effects on clinical outcomes in a number of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) than is commonly seen with prospective trials.	StudyDuration
The average duration of the follow-up period of our study is about 2 years.	StudyDuration
The duration of the treatment may be too short for definitive testing of the effect of angiogenesis in adult patients in a more clinically relevant study.	StudyDuration
However, it could be premature to assess treatment effects due to inadequate clinical recollection of patients with inflammatory arthritis.	StudyDuration
One issue with our study was the short duration of the study.	StudyDuration
Second, the trial period would have to be shorter than 9 months for clinical evaluation.	StudyDuration
Moreover, a 6-month follow-up is needed to identify the duration of effects of antidepressant treatment, which is a critical consideration in such a short study.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of the current study is that the number of clinical data obtained from patients in the intervention was not consistent with the number of patients in the intervention who had complete information, which can be explained by the lack of routine follow-up.	MissingData
Another limitation of our analysis is that we did not have adequate numbers of ED patients and thus had no data on ED visits after the second intervention.	MissingData
However, a limitation of our study was the lack of follow-up of patients with chronic respiratory disease (CRD).	MissingData
Because of the limited clinical outcomes, this strategy was terminated within 5 years of intervention and remained suspended beyond 6 years.	MissingData
However, the lower percentage of study participants enrolled in the MRT study (see Table 1) might have been due to a lack of motivation.	MissingData
The absence of a second physical examination in all four subjects further clarifies the limitations of the study.	MissingData
However, the lack of data collected on the baseline of the T1Ds in the second study suggests the possibility of missing some timepoints.	MissingData
The most important finding was that 88.9% of patients (n=12) completed the TRICT (see Figure 1.1.a).	MissingData
We did not have adequate data on blood glucose levels, and this may reflect the small number of patients who were not randomly assigned to the study.	MissingData
We also did not have information on the severity of clinical depression during the pharmacokinetic trial.	MissingData
Interestingly, we could not obtain information on how many daily hours of exercise the subjects spent in each activity, and therefore could not determine whether this was due to motivation or stress.	MissingData
As a consequence of the lack of data to evaluate effect sizes, we could not conduct further analyses of non-clinical studies with regard to the effect of treatment.	MissingData
First, despite our efforts, we did not obtain the mean total duration of daily urinalysis (maximum duration of 7 days), which was high at 65% in both study arms.	MissingData
Because there was no interview follow-up at the end of the trial, the sample size is a problem for this intervention.	MissingData
There were not sufficient follow-up and observation data after discontinuation of the T-DOG study.	MissingData
As a result, a study with the same treatment group is much more likely to be administered with a high confidence level, so some degree of skepticism about the treatment allocation would be expected.	Blinding
A potential source of bias, if any, would be the non-blinding of participants from the other groups.	Blinding
In addition, it is difficult to establish what bias there may have been in the blinding of participants to the treatment, as this would be problematic in cases of unexpected outcome or in the absence of a significant placebo effect.	Blinding
We cannot rule out the possibility of unblinding of an interviewer in the absence of treatment intention.	Blinding
In addition, clinicians could have influenced the outcome of the intervention by adjusting for the treatment group that they selected.	Blinding
In addition, a bias could have occurred if a patient became disorientated by the intervention, especially if the patient reverted to a higher dose of dosing.	Blinding
Moreover, the blinded group is difficult to define and would likely be biased by participants or clinicians.	Blinding
If the intervention was not blinded, it may have been the result of unblinding in the patient, as the interventionist was unaware of the treatment group.	Blinding
An additional source of bias could be present in the form of a post-treatment study, or patient blinding by clinicians completing the study.	Blinding
The study group in the HLH study did not have a fully controlled relationship with the practice management team, and therefore, it is difficult to predict which patient is most important.	Blinding
Alternatively, patients may have assumed that the intervention was blinded by the interventionist, but this is unlikely to have been the case.	Blinding
The participants in this study were not blinded, which was desirable but unlikely because it would be difficult to detect the true treatment group.	Blinding
Although unmeasured, this logical assumption would not be valid because a dyad was applied after each visit and the dyad may be referred in some other way.	Blinding
If participants were not blinded to their intervention, it is possible that the unblinded intervention was biased.	Blinding
Consequently, our analyses did not include the use of the “true” treatment group to avoid unintentional mishaps.	Blinding
Because of the nature of the tests we conducted and the potential for multiple outcomes, we cannot make generalized conclusions about the nature of causal relationships.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, multiple analysis could account for all outcomes that were measured, but our hypothesised model is not robust enough to account for such a wide variety of outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, a number of secondary outcomes were found, which may rely on the interaction effect, but there are unknown confounders.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, because we were not concerned about the quality of treatment for dementia, we trimmed down on the number of primary outcomes (M and Q) and compared them.	StatisticalAnalysis
Lastly, our results could be constrained by a possible misinterpretation of multiple outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
As the multiple regression model was not adjusted for multiple independent factors, it is possible that there are important causal interactions that explain the significant difference between the two models.	StatisticalAnalysis
Third, although we did not adjust for multiple outcomes in the analysis, it is possible that we did not control for major risks of diabetes, such as smoking, from which we have no way to assess risk.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, although the analysis was carefully constructed, we did not adjust for multiple measures of stressors in the outcome analyses (Table 4).	StatisticalAnalysis
The significance of multivariate analysis can be reduced by a potential limit on determining the effect of the drug on blood pressure and diabetes, but this limitation is limited because we did not have sufficient data to compare multiple outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, we had other groups analyzed and thus the impact of each event is uncertain.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, we tested for multiple predictors of heart rate, blood pressure and glucose levels, all of which could have influenced heart rate.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, because of our observational design, we did not test for multiple outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Therefore, our multiple regression model is vulnerable to error.	StatisticalAnalysis
Another limitation of our method is the requirement for multiple analyses.	StatisticalAnalysis
Third, we did not perform a paired analysis, which may be the reason we didn't include the major factor in the Cox model for predicting BMD in women and the aging of aging brain.	StatisticalAnalysis
The current control (not shown) contains a matched placebo and is not possible to test the effectiveness of our treatment.	Control
The control arm of the study was used to compare the effects of each treatment group.	Control
In this context, we tested two groups of control arms in order to assess the efficacy of both arms.	Control
We should evaluate whether the control option was appropriate because of the high toxicity of a single drug and the lack of efficacy of the intervention.	Control
As a control, our study also considered a placebo group which had more time to adapt and adjust to the differences in workload.	Control
In addition to the randomized nature of the trial, a control was used to compare the effects of the experimental drugs and treatment protocols in addition to the group of healthy volunteers treated by a placebo group.	Control
In addition, the use of a placebo group during our trial was not required, but could provide insight into the possible differences between the two groups of cicada in these situations.	Control
Furthermore, as the control was not planned to be administered, neither arm in the study (control arm) or arms of the control arm had an active role in the outcome assessment.	Control
The absence of a placebo control, however, suggested that an intervention with active vs. passive cardiovascular measures would be more successful in controlling the risk of septic shock.	Control
Because neither of these 2 treatments was controlled, a placebo arm was therefore not used.	Control
In our trial it was used as a control in order to compare the beneficial effects of these drugs in the treatment of those with more severe or more serious diseases and injuries.	Control
In the absence of a placebo, if any of the interventions listed below were given, it is unknown how effective they were.	Control
This trial had no placebo arm and there was no other control arm (in this group we had no placebo arm, so no comparison with an in-class placebo arm).	Control
The sham treatment group was not given time, thus the absence of any control in this trial has been ascribed to the lack of intervention in this group of patients and to the largely unsuccessful attempt to assess its effect on clinical outcome.	Control
In this trial, neither of the two arms was active in determining the overall therapeutic benefit.	Control
In addition, we have inadequate information on a number of patients who were withdrawn from the study, both from the ICMA and from other study arms, indicating low response rate.	MissingData
Second, our lack of blood tests did not reach our desired level of data for the drDNA gene methylation status in patients after the first day of follow-up.	MissingData
A second limitation of our study was the absence of time and date for reassessment of treatment outcomes.	MissingData
The main limitation of our study is the completeness of the analyses but also the fact that participants were not informed about their treatment regimens and therefore did not receive follow-up visits.	MissingData
However, the lower number of participants with chronic conditions than in the other groups may be attributed to low motivation and the absence of any self-reports for follow-up, which may have contributed to greater dropout.	MissingData
However, we did not have time to take a follow-up survey of the operative and clinical factors in the patients enrolled in the study.	MissingData
This reflects the fact that our analyses of dietary intake and physical activity levels were not systematically recorded and did not allow for complete information about dietary intake and physical activity levels.	MissingData
Our data collection strategies did not allow for complete assessment of patient clinical responses.	MissingData
The reassessment of the study’s outcome (measure of satisfaction, satisfaction with the outcome), and the decision to withdraw from the study to be removed from the study are probably influenced by the absence of objective assessments of the effects of intervention.	MissingData
As the study was carried out in the hospital setting, participants did not have access to their clinical and hospital care record.	MissingData
Despite the availability of medical records, there is an evident nexus between the study outcomes and the duration of study participation.	MissingData
Furthermore, a large proportion of participants did not complete a randomized follow-up, resulting in significant limitation on our ability to identify potential treatment interventions.	MissingData
Although the study was completed in about half of the participants, there was some concern about the proportion of patients who were withdrawn.	MissingData
Lastly, notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations of the COMPASS Trial, we did not have any data on body temperature and body temperature.	MissingData
First, we did not obtain data for the presence of pre-mortem blood samples (although we were able to obtain data from menstrual blood glucose systolic pressure and weight).	MissingData
The study duration was 3 years, although one possibility is that there are additional benefits to being on the medication during the duration of therapy than was originally anticipated.	StudyDuration
However, although the effects of oral steroids remain after 3 years, we concluded that long-term maintenance treatment was unlikely to be helpful in the long-term.	StudyDuration
Although we did not extend the duration of the clinical trials to 6 years, we concluded that the effect of treatment was not sustained for the duration of the trial.	StudyDuration
A follow-up period is desirable in a prospective analysis.	StudyDuration
Further, the length of the study may have influenced our results.	StudyDuration
Despite these results, the duration of the clinical trial is short.	StudyDuration
The study is not long enough to establish the duration of a positive association between oral iron intake and weight loss but is long enough to be an assessment tool to evaluate the clinical relevance of oral iron intake in the treatment of msd, in particular for those with chronic msd.	StudyDuration
The short duration of our prospective trial could be problematic in the long-term if we wish to test our hypothesis about the influence of nutrition on disease risk and severity.	StudyDuration
Alternatively, we did not find any evidence of an effect on survival at 12 months but we were cautious because it might be necessary to follow a long-term intervention in this type of intervention.	StudyDuration
Moreover, the time-course of the improvement in the clinical course could vary significantly from study to study; however, if the changes in the patients were to remain, we would be able to evaluate the effects on the clinical course.	StudyDuration
We found it unlikely that a 6-month follow-up would be adequate for definitively establishing a causal relationship.	StudyDuration
The trial duration was only short-term but should not serve as a guide to assessing the effectiveness of the treatment.	StudyDuration
Finally, it may not be feasible to enroll a longer follow-up period for clinical trials at the moment.	StudyDuration
The study also used 2 year follow-up to determine the effects of lithium supplementation on syphilis infection and has not been extended to evaluate long-term effects.	StudyDuration
We had a shorter treatment duration than expected because of a longer duration of follow-up than expected in the prospective population, but this was only a short-term measure to investigate the impact of long-term follow-up on early onset dementia.	StudyDuration
The active control comparator did not have the benefits resulting from the addition of a placebo arm, which could explain the difference between the two arms.	Control
By contrast, the absence of an active control component may explain the smaller numbers in the placebo arm of a placebo arm.	Control
It is therefore difficult to judge whether the control strategy that was introduced was successful in achieving the therapeutic objectives, in part because of the limitation of the trial design.	Control
By using this trial, the authors could exclude the placebo control, which would not have slowed the effect of the intervention, on the risk of stroke in both arms.	Control
Therefore, no active control group was used in this trial — only the active arm, the two groups that received the majority of the dosage, and the placebo group.	Control
If the patients were in an active control group, they would have received a larger dose of cisplatin than in the placebo arm of this study, thus allowing an equivalent treatment for these common conditions.	Control
Therefore, a placebo group was not appropriate to test the effects of ophthalmomycin or in this particular study in our study of ophthalmomycin.	Control
We have not assessed the effectiveness of treatment in reducing the risk of NTN in the control arm, so this study could not compare the effect of DMD to the control arm.	Control
We were not able to control for treatment differences in the intervention and therefore did not decide which of the two arms to use.	Control
The control was a comparison to other interventions in the literature which were not as efficacious.	Control
Therefore, the control group of the study did not have the same number of participants in either arm.	Control
The choice of the active treatment in the current trial did not limit the impact of the sedative treatment.	Control
Therefore neither the active control nor the placebo arm were used in the study.	Control
The current study comparing these two approaches would be incomplete without the intervention of either of the groups in our study.	Control
Therefore it is possible that our control could be more beneficial for achieving the therapeutic objectives that may have been achieved by using either a placebo or a active control.	Control
Moreover, our findings are generalizable only to patients with diabetes mellitus, who are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.	Generalization
Therefore, it is important that the results of our study be interpreted with caution as some of our findings may not transfer to the general population.	Generalization
Thus, it is possible that our results might not be generalizable to other settings.	Generalization
Furthermore, the results may be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the study center; in other words, the results may not be generalizable to persons near the center.	Generalization
This conclusion has a potential limitation in the generalization of the results.	Generalization
This study may not be generalizable to patients with vascular disease who have a common pathological condition, and so can not be generalized.	Generalization
In addition, given the limited number of studies which used the same data, it may be difficult to generalize the results to other equine studies in the general population.	Generalization
Therefore, because our findings were limited in a way of generalizability, the outcome described here is not applicable to other study designs and patients with similar clinical conditions.	Generalization
Finally, since the results of our study were only available in our laboratory, there is some uncertainty about whether or not the results could be generalized to patients in other groups.	Generalization
This limitations the generalization of the results to other types of patients would be restricted by the fact that we had conducted the study on patients with CRC >10 weeks old (conventional craniotomy for children, adult craniotomy for adults).	Generalization
The findings of the present study cannot be generalized to other settings or patients in the acute limb ache group, but the findings of the current study may have some influence on the interpretation of our findings.	Generalization
The results from this study are relevant only for patients with BRD who are stable, healthy, and at least at baseline.	Generalization
Second, our results may not be generalizable beyond the US.	Generalization
The results of our study can not be applied to all settings.	Generalization
Furthermore, the results in this case report may not apply to all patients in the same patient group (e.g. if patients are treated with clozapine and the condition has a vascular component) and it is therefore not yet clear whether the results in this case study should be generalised to all patients with vascular disease.	Generalization
First, it is possible that participants and staff in the first year may have been blinded, so the sensitivity of the analysis to non-blinding would be greater.	Blinding
The patient had to be blinded to the results because, for example, there could be considerable overlap in study results between participants.	Blinding
The clinicians in the BP group were blinded to the intention of receiving a single intervention, but the results may be incompletely reported by the interviewer or participants.	Blinding
The authors are not sure whether participants were blinded, but the intervention was ideally performed by trained professionals.	Blinding
The intervention team may have chosen to not blind the patients, but it is unlikely that this will have resulted in a significant bias as this intervention lacked a predilection for patient self-reporting.	Blinding
Alternatively, as a secondary measure, patients would have been blinded to the treatment they received.	Blinding
The investigators did not blind participants to the intervention.	Blinding
First, patients may not have been blinded, because participants may have participated in an objective controlled experiment (such as a pharmacological or biological study).	Blinding
A single study, usually in the form of self-assessment, may not be as important as a double blind.	Blinding
The authors believe that a high level of intertrial consistency in the study results is needed to ensure that the intervention was correctly assessed and reported.	Blinding
Because of the nature of the intervention, it is possible for participants to be unblinded, such as a person with diabetes at the time of their intervention.	Blinding
The patient blinding to the intervention protocol would also have to be considered in order to describe the effect of intervention on patients’ responses, which could be increased by using a double-blinding technique.	Blinding
If patients were blinded, they would not have viewed the intervention as a positive outcome.	Blinding
The intervention team must be blinded.	Blinding
Although participants were not blinded to the results of their treatment, the bias resulting from the use of this study, which is similar to the blinding by participants in the ED study, could have been significant as a result of the sedation protocols or of the combination of interventions administered to the participants.	Blinding
The treatment group did not receive a placebo group or an active control arm which has been demonstrated to be more effective.	Control
Therefore, as neither the ssh-treatment nor the placebo group had adequate control groups, it is possible that some differences in these groups may have been due to the effects of the different treatments, resulting in differences in both baseline and endpoint physiologic behaviours.	Control
This may not have been possible with the combination of a treatment group that did not include any intervention such as a placebo arm.	Control
We may not have had the advantage of having a treatment comparing treatment responses with a placebo or with a standardised control, since it would have been difficult to quantify the effects of our intervention on participants.	Control
As such, it is not possible to determine the beneficial effects of introducing a controlled treatment to the population.	Control
Thus the control arm was therefore missing from this study.	Control
The active control in this trial was a placebo and therefore did not include any medication.	Control
The control group did not have either of the two interventions to compare with, because it was too small and not specific enough to capture the effects of the intervention.	Control
This study did not include a control arm and had therefore not been performed on this basis.	Control
Our control trial contained both a placebo and a control arm that had been established previously, but this trial did not include a placebo arm.	Control
The control randomized trial sat against the randomized treatment arm with the syringe and needles.	Control
Because of the small number of patients enrolled in a randomised controlled trial, it was not possible to exclude an active treatment arm based on the risk factors of acute coronary syndrome.	Control
As an outcome of this study, the role of placebo was unclear and thus difficult to assess.	Control
In our comparison, our control group received a placebo which was not necessary as the study was done to assess the efficacy of the intervention, and the goal of the study was to determine the optimal dose.	Control
The control intervention is not well-studied, but is in the same group of people with pulmonary emboli.	Control
In addition, however, the patient-to-patient effect size was smaller and this has implications for the treatment pattern across analyses.	Randomization
One limitation of the randomization procedure is the difference between the control and xenograft groups.	Randomization
Another issue with the sample design is that the primary outcome (prognosis of edema) was significantly different between the two groups of patients and therefore this difference might account for the variation in edema rates across groups.	Randomization
Because of the smaller sample size, it is difficult to predict which drug condition would be associated with the most acute side effects in the clinical setting.	Randomization
Because randomization is a more reliable method of measuring obesogenic effects, it is important to ensure the same treatment arms were used.	Randomization
Given the small number of co-morbidities that were found in randomised samples, a possible explanation for the variation in the study population may be that the iatrogenic effect of iatrogenic chemotherapy was smaller and therefore may have resulted in bias.	Randomization
This observation had an effect on mortality and its effect on health status, but the effect on mortality may have been greater than in the other study.	Randomization
Furthermore, a significant difference in the response rate between the two groups was the size of the dose, which could account for some of the observed heterogeneity in response rates.	Randomization
In addition, the treatment-seeking effect was small for the nephro-surgery groups but large for other groups and the analysis of covariates, and was less important for the subsequent clinical outcome, particularly when treatment outcomes differed.	Randomization
In contrast, though the effect of group randomization on study outcomes may have been greater for patients with a poorer prognosis than for healthy patients, the effect of randomisation also affected edema risk, even if there was no randomization.	Randomization
We chose to randomly select a further treatment, a procedure with the same treatment options as our primary treatment, but the resulting significant difference in treatment outcomes was not due to the small sample size.	Randomization
The study was not randomised, implying that a small number of patients had already been randomly selected.	Randomization
Moreover, the study is not random and the occlusion of univariate effects may have reduced our power to detect causal relationships between these two studies.	Randomization
The patient population tended to be more highly sexed and therefore the proportion of female patients with breast cancer in the group with high systolic blood pressure could have increased.	Randomization
A smaller effect size is less likely in patients who were randomised in the first and last group than in the second, and more people with high blood pressure or BP may have had blood loss in the second group.	Randomization
As a result, the analysis was not extended to 8-months.	StudyDuration
The results are only meaningful at a longer time point.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of this study is the 6-month duration.	StudyDuration
However, the shorter duration of follow-up may be misleading because it is too early to determine the long-term effects of drug treatments on chronic diseases.	StudyDuration
The short duration of our study could be useful to clarify the optimal treatment timing, e.g. a 12-month trial.	StudyDuration
This study was based on short-term follow-up only and there are no follow-up data on a long-term follow-up period.	StudyDuration
However, longer durations may be necessary because of the long term nature of the clinical trials and the shorter duration of the follow-up induced by long-term etiological stimulation.	StudyDuration
This is an unusually short duration of intervention in a multicentre multicenter clinical trial.	StudyDuration
In addition, if an arithmetic model is used for the treatment of osteoporosis, it is not possible to determine the duration of neuropathic pain in the long-term.	StudyDuration
However, it is likely that this might be insufficient to detect the effect of a prophylactic antithyroid treatment.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of our study is the short trial duration, which would be useful in understanding the effect of treatment on weight loss.	StudyDuration
Lastly, the two year duration of the clinical follow-up might be short.	StudyDuration
However, it would not be possible to exclude adverse effects in this condition in the course of treatment.	StudyDuration
However, in the event of the absence of a good clinical outcome, we would need to extend our trial to a 6-month period, at least initially.	StudyDuration
Second, a short time frame cannot capture the full effect of treatment, because it would require a longer follow-up period to accurately define treatment effects.	StudyDuration
Third, the length of the trial is one of the factors which affect the effects of prophylactic interventions, and therefore we chose to extend our study to six years rather than three.	StudyDuration
The final study of this meta-analysis only looked at the effects over the initial two years of treatment (one-year time period).	StudyDuration
Secondly, we assessed for the long term effects of lithium in this population but did not assess the long-term impact on treatment.	StudyDuration
The final analysis of this study suggests that our analysis is not comprehensive and that it is not appropriate for long-term follow-up in the absence of any other important findings.	StudyDuration
A longer duration could have led to an accelerated response, but we did not expect any definite treatment effect and may not be able to provide a longer-term observational study.	StudyDuration
However, in our group, follow-up lasted only two years, making it desirable to conclude a longer period of follow-up, and that an active treatment for depression in young children may be the best option.	StudyDuration
Finally, we did not include a 6-month extension of the study duration as it would be desirable to establish whether this observation is associated with long-term benefits.	StudyDuration
The early phase of a meta-analysis would be the appropriate length to consider the effects of treatment on clinical outcomes in a longitudinal setting.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, it would have been desirable to test whether the positive effects of long-term anti-depressants will continue to accumulate even if the study ended at 6-months.	StudyDuration
One limitation of this study is that although some improvement is seen in time, there are no long-term studies which have a favourable effect on disease progression.	StudyDuration
Second, although the placebo-controlled trial was only for a few months, it is possible that longer term treatment is needed to achieve significant treatment effects.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, the trial has been closed for several months, so it may not be possible to identify the end-points that should be considered in future studies.	StudyDuration
The results suggest that the effect of a longer-term follow-up period may be more permanent in the future, but we are not sure whether this is so.	StudyDuration
Second, it is difficult to assess whether long-term changes in serum glutamate levels can alter the pathological changes over time that may result from chronic steroid use.	StudyDuration
Second, the median duration of our treatment did not meet the criteria for long-term follow-up, as the benefits were felt in the shorter term, but a longer follow-up is useful to understand the effect of long-term follow-up.	StudyDuration
We further caution that the results of our analysis were not generalizable to all patients.	Generalization
The findings of this study cannot be generalized to all patients with irradiated heart arrhythmias.	Generalization
The generalizability of our findings may be limited to the case presented, in which the evaluator was a student rather than a teacher and thus not applicable to all settings.	Generalization
The authors are limited in their ability to generalize the results to other populations.	Generalization
Because our results are not applicable to patients in the United Kingdom, they cannot be generalized to the population that lives in these locations.	Generalization
Furthermore, it would be important for the external validation of the results to include non-neurologist patients in the cohort.	Generalization
Finally, while the results described in the paper are specific to a particular case, the authors’ finding may not be generalizable to patients with other acute conditions.	Generalization
We also consider the limitations of this study in the possibility of implementing the findings of the AMR in all cases of intracranial hemorrhage, and our interpretation will be limited.	Generalization
The results from our study could not be generalized to patients with other comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus.	Generalization
The PKR results should only be generalized to adults with more severe BP, and the results obtained should not be generalized to all patients with BP.	Generalization
Finally, the findings in our study may not be generalizable beyond the general population.	Generalization
This may limit the extrapolation of the findings to the larger cohort of patients with diabetes and the associated complications, resulting in an individual difference between the effect size of the nebulizer and nebulizer.	Generalization
We expect that the results of our study were not generalizable to the general population due to our limitations on the application of our results to individual patients.	Generalization
Secondly, it is important that our results be reproduced in the general population in order to avoid confounding.	Generalization
Therefore, it is important to note that the results of our study were generalized to other centers of acute care as well.	Generalization
The exploratory nature of the trial was difficult to analyze.	StudyDesign
Intervention trials were used to assess the feasibility of prospectively collected data.	StudyDesign
The study was large and open.	StudyDesign
In addition, there was a small number of data tables that did not allow us to test for potential biases, such as non-conventional design or adherence to the trial’s adherence schedule.	StudyDesign
In addition, a small number of randomised visits to secondary care sites and a few randomised subgroups made it necessary to discuss potential ramifications.	StudyDesign
The study design is inherently complex, and we cannot propose a formal protocol or consent process.	StudyDesign
The study was not well-planned and participants were asked to use the standard outcome measures of the study such as age, race and gender.	StudyDesign
In addition, the prospective design is nonrandomized and is thus limited in its range of potential impact on the population.	StudyDesign
Multivariate design limits the number of controlled trials – we did not allow use of a “stratification” – and the use of a cluster-randomized design is restricted to assessing the quality of our services and not to identifying “hard to implement” interventions.	StudyDesign
Despite the relatively small sample size of our trial, we have made a clear commitment to explore alternative methods to evaluating treatment effects.	StudyDesign
Although we did not design our trial to collect data in a blinded fashion, this approach allowed us to develop an agnostic sample of non-cognitive behavioral outcomes in an open-label clinical trial setting.	StudyDesign
Our study was not designed to generate final data in a form which is suitable for data analysis and analysis.	StudyDesign
Additionally, while the results of the study may not be applicable to all participants, they may be applicable to individuals with a limited financial means.	StudyDesign
In addition, our study was small and a pilot-study design was used, making it a bit challenging to implement our research design.	StudyDesign
The study design was limited by the need to establish the need for additional co-registration and for further study design adjustments.	StudyDesign
Some of the primary findings of the study could be limited by study design, for example adherence to a placebo group would have to be modified, especially if there were questions about feasibility, economics or regulatory constraints.	StudyDesign
While we did not plan to test cluster randomization, we did want to try to assess our ability to achieve efficacy, and to refine our data collection, dissemination and analysis tools.	StudyDesign
The use of a randomized controlled trial is also interesting because of the need to adjust for complication, which is important to understanding how small-scale studies of clinical trials may be useful.	StudyDesign
The study design was loose and open to flexibility - it was therefore important to account for the varying nature of our randomized control trial.	StudyDesign
This study was partially randomized, but because it was not randomized, we had to reject some of the analyses that were designed to assess the effect of randomization on outcomes, such as the presence of a significant effect on adolescent blood sugar levels.	StudyDesign
Our study was not designed for a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial and our outcomes were therefore difficult to test in a randomized fashion.	StudyDesign
The primary design focuses on assessing and monitoring effects of a randomized controlled trial; it is thus important to discuss the potential limitations of this study.	StudyDesign
A pilot study does not allow for the use of a significative endpoint to determine a causal effect.	StudyDesign
Despite our limitations, the results may have limitations regarding identifying the risk factors for adverse events.	StudyDesign
The study was partially randomized, which means that we did not explore the impact of clustering.	StudyDesign
Some studies have some flexibility with regards to sampling and the study design.	StudyDesign
Cluster randomizations are less formal than randomised controlled trials and are not intended to provide a formal basis for the analysis of individual patient outcomes.	StudyDesign
This pilot study was not intended to be a clinical trial; however, it may have implications for current cGMT and clinical trials.	StudyDesign
The limitations in our study are imposed by the fact that we did not permit the use of a formal registry system, which makes it difficult to calculate the effect size for an independent randomization design.	StudyDesign
Although the study was limited to only a few sites, it provided an opportunity to test the feasibility of a number of methods and the need for inclusion of a single randomization.	StudyDesign
The current trial has an indefinite termination date of 1 year after the end of the intervention, and a large number of patients have lost interest in the study (5%).	MissingData
Second, the absence of all otolaryngology studies may have contributed to our lack of complete information.	MissingData
We did not obtain data from all participants in the IRIS trial.	MissingData
We could not obtain all the demographic characteristics of patients who took part in the study, nor were their gender characteristics, age and gender ratios or phenotypes included in the analysis.	MissingData
Similarly, the high rate of non-responders in the study and the lack of post-treatment follow-up was problematic.	MissingData
In our second trial, the number of patients withdrawn from the study was substantial and probably due to lack of interest in the intervention, but this was a limitation because many of the patients were in a less-active position.	MissingData
Finally, although we could identify patients who had received i-bupropion treatment before withdrawal from the study, there was no follow-up or data collection after the withdrawal.	MissingData
Second, our missing data in the tetanus-test was somewhat higher than in the eta3 and bpT test (15 %) (Table 3).	MissingData
Because of this limitation, we were unable to collect complete assessments of these patients in the second cycle of the study.	MissingData
We also received non-clinical data regarding the rate of oral rehydration to the endpoint (trial-time at baseline, duration of rehydration, and duration of the oral rehydration).	MissingData
There was no comprehensive follow-up of patients enrolled in the intervention; furthermore, a greater proportion of study participants (11%) left the study after the first month, resulting in substantial missing data in the secondary endpoint.	MissingData
To further refine the evaluation, we did not collect any laboratory information related to the impact of the study on the individual patient’s health and the type of conditions they faced.	MissingData
In addition, we were not able to identify the age of patients in the TLC study.	MissingData
The most significant limitation of the study is its absence of blood sample or serum urogenital measurements.	MissingData
It was further problematic for us to be unable to estimate how many patients completed the study.	MissingData
This study was not randomized, and did not cover at least three participants.	MissingData
Although some limitations of the study design were evident, there was little difference in patients' occurrence and intensity of treatment over the three time periods.	MissingData
Another limitation of this study was the lack of follow-up data.	MissingData
However, we could not identify a precise number of patients with clinically significant early-onset symptoms, or significant time-to-symptom duration, with an impact on symptom severity, which may account for the high number of missed doses.	MissingData
Moreover, we did not get to know how many subjects completed the assessment subsequently.	MissingData
Another limitation is the absence of clinical data for at least 175 of all non-nave participants from both arm(s), which is a limitation.	MissingData
This limitation is further exacerbated by the fact that participants in both of the two arms did not supply their baseline body mass index (BMI) at baseline.	MissingData
We had only partial responses for all subgroups.	MissingData
Secondly, participants were reluctant to return to the e-mail account of a visit from the EBM consultant.	MissingData
In addition to an extremely high proportion of dropouts in the intervention arm, a significant proportion of patients in the intervention arm chose to withdraw their participation from the study.	MissingData
We were unable to provide comprehensive information on dietary intake, diet, exercise, and nutritional status in the second and third trials, although we were aware that those who took the supplementation regimen had their intakes reduced.	MissingData
Although there was significant variation in mortality at randomization, data on mortality were not available.	MissingData
There was a low proportion of participants with symptomatic obstructive sleep and ear sounds in the morning and midday hours.	MissingData
The primary limitation of this study was the non-retention of ED in the follow-up visits.	MissingData
In addition, only 26% of participants in the control arm were available for medical imaging.	MissingData
This was partly due to the small number of participants from the NIR-A study not participating in all the clinical trials.	MissingData
This is because we did not collect complete patient data in our randomized trials, and we also did not collect detailed clinical variables.	MissingData
The presence of adverse events in the three trial arms also raises concerns about the proportions of patients who do not participate in the study.	MissingData
As a result, the sample sizes of some of the intervention arms were small, not allowing for the interpretation of some of the analyses.	MissingData
Finally, there was a high proportion of placebo-controlled patients (> 65%) who left the study after completing the study.	MissingData
Although the study was not randomized, the results of the cohort follow-up were not collected at the time of the follow-up, which is consistent with our findings.	MissingData
Second, in the latter study, we only collected vital data on the patient during hospitalization, so some uncertainties were present regarding patient outcomes, such as how long hospitalizations were occurring and how long the hospital was closed.	MissingData
We were unable to obtain blood glucose and electrocardiogram data in patients with diabetes in the second and third rounds of the evaluator.	MissingData
Further, the data collection time of the study for the patients is approximately two weeks, and our 2 hours study time is approximately 2 weeks longer than for the control group, which would explain some of the high dropout rate.	MissingData
We had no data for a symptom and clinical outcome measurement (e.g.	MissingData
As a result of the lack of a single follow-up, we could not obtain an update of all patients within the intervention.	MissingData
The 6-month duration of the follow-up was long, a result of the large number of exclusions.	MissingData
Finally, our results suggest that the observed improvement in cardiovascular events at age 70 is associated with a higher risk of non-cardiogenic cardiovascular disease, which may explain our higher participation rates.	MissingData
Moreover, this study was not repeated in the follow-up (for both patients and clinicians) due to differences in study design, which led to a smaller proportion of patients (N = 61).	MissingData
This is due to a high proportion of patients missing from the trial.	MissingData
In addition, data on blood pressure during treatment and on serum cholesterol levels were not available in some of the patients.	MissingData
We cannot be sure of the age of the participants in the intervention groups after treatment with entropic medications (11 years) and the frequency of the evaluative interview (1 hour) among patients with edema (3 months) were available at the time of evaluation.	MissingData
Another limitation was the small sample size in the follow-up data, which is attributed to the limited number of participants who took part in the follow-up and the lack of follow-up data for patients in whom the intervention was not successful.	MissingData
Furthermore, the absence of baseline BP measurements at baseline was a limitation, particularly to the non-selected subgroup.	MissingData
In addition to the missing data in sexes, some patients were unable to complete medical history.	MissingData
This limitation may be due to the lack of patient-reported data regarding comorbidity and other factors (e.g., age, gender, smoking status, dietary intake and age of patients).	MissingData
The nature of our sample size in this study and the time period in which we received our data was challenging.	MissingData
Lastly, in many patients who left the trial, the primary study data was not available (e.g.	MissingData
We were unable to obtain the outcome measures of dilated and/or obliterated pupils from all five participants.	MissingData
A limitation of this study was that it excluded a large number of patients who declined clinical evaluation, causing a high percentage of dropout.	MissingData
Moreover, our patients were not willing to undergo a follow-up after 1 year of treatment.	MissingData
Furthermore, the sample size for individual 3 kg of creatinine was much smaller than that of participants participating in the BRANDA and CORTEX trials, a proportion that may have contributed to a decrease in the efficacy of the intervention.	MissingData
We lacked patient and hospital contacts to provide us with valuable clinical data (Table 2).	MissingData
Unfortunately, there were no follow-up visits on the remaining patients.	MissingData
In addition to the number of ovulatory, metabolic and thoracic heart rate measurements, we did not have blood pressure data, which may have contributed to our overall neocortisone-related decline, but there was no change in total thoracic heart rate at baseline.	MissingData
It was unclear what proportion of patients in the ACT group died and it was not possible to ascertain the cause of death.	MissingData
The lack of clinical data for one of the arms meant that a proportion of participants were unable to enter the Xenogliol-controlled trial and it was difficult to compare the clinical effect with the data on clinical outcome.	MissingData
Although the patients in the trial attended the weekly clinic visits, we did not receive a patient assessment visit.	MissingData
We did not obtain the first two months of data for the study participants who were unable to complete the study.	MissingData
Another limitation is the short follow-up time.	MissingData
Finally, it was not possible to observe any change in symmetry between study participants between time points and within a single week.	MissingData
Thirdly, we were not able to collect information about all participants within the randomized study.	MissingData
Unfortunately, we did not obtain complete comorbidity or mortality information from any patient in this study.	MissingData
As an observational study, we are unable to obtain laboratory data for most invasive and noninvasive laboratory and pathologic parameters for the entire intervention group, including CNS and GYN.	MissingData
Second, we did not collect any medical history for each patient, despite our efforts to collect some of the most accurate patient information.	MissingData
Lastly, the absence of an independent follow-up after a single study, is inconclusive for defining a meaningful difference in quality of life (and thereby reducing our risk of bias in our study).	MissingData
Finally, we did not have telephone contact to check comorbidity or clinical severity, but some patients reported experiencing more acute nausea or vomiting in the first year of intervention.	MissingData
We could not ascertain the specific pharmacokinetic profile in patients admitted to the study, due to potential loss of weight.	MissingData
One limitation of our study was that we did not collect blood glucose, serum and urine, and therefore missed a significant proportion of clinical trials.	MissingData
Notably, the absence of complete pharmacokinetic data could have affected outcomes, resulting in an insufficient interpretation of data on patients with dyslipidemia and hypertension.	MissingData
However, it was concluded that the time frame of the study was short.	StudyDuration
However, this approach is only feasible for shorter durations than 3 years (see Figure 1).	StudyDuration
Finally, our timeframe may have been too short to evaluate the effects of treatment.	StudyDuration
Second, the time horizon for treatment extension is rather long, which is relevant for the clinical effects of Xanax on the quality of life.	StudyDuration
First, there is no set time frame for an end point analysis of the effects of antithrombotic drugs and hence the long-term effect on the risk of CNS disease was very short.	StudyDuration
It would be interesting to investigate the effect of magnesium chelation on risk of osteoporosis over a longer period of time.	StudyDuration
Third, a longer period of follow up is needed for long-term results.	StudyDuration
We felt that it would be appropriate to examine the effects of anabolic steroids on long-term success rates, as these effects can only be observed in the short term.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, it is not easy to prove that a 6-month window of dosing would be adequate to achieve clinical improvement.	StudyDuration
Although we did not have a time limit for study termination, the positive effects of lithium may be apparent even after the end of the treatment and we expect long-term follow-up.	StudyDuration
The study did not allow the assessment of a long-term pharmacokinetic response to the anesthetic and the effects of oral medications in patients with DAE.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of this study is the short time frame.	StudyDuration
However, while longer follow-up was feasible, prolonged follow-up would have to be considered in this study to gain additional information on the benefit of lithium over the placebo.	StudyDuration
A longer duration would be needed to assess the effect of treatment intervention on post-mortem disability, but later follow-up is probably required to determine long-term effect.	StudyDuration
However, the evaluation was not extended and at some point it was possible that the effect of therapy could be more pronounced during the shorter duration of the study.	StudyDuration
First, participants may not have been blinded because it was not routine to be blinded to the intention to receive an intervention.	Blinding
This is possible because we were not blinded to the intervention given in the intervention laboratory.	Blinding
The use of a second intervention at the end of the intervention, for example, does not ensure that the study was fully blinded.	Blinding
The trial participants did not know which group they were involved in.	Blinding
In addition, we did not know which researchers administered which interventions.	Blinding
However, as a first timer, participants may have been blinded to the outcome of their treatment and this may have resulted in some variability in treatment outcome.	Blinding
A further challenge is the large number of participants and potential participants who have been blinded to receive an individual treatment.	Blinding
In addition, there was no apparent blinding to the intervention compared with the therapists, which would have caused confusion when interpreting the results.	Blinding
Similarly, in the event that participants are not blinded, the results of the intervention may have been slightly different.	Blinding
In addition, patients were not blinded to study outcomes at the end of the study and could be influenced by changes in behaviour in patients after the study, causing changes in the quality of care resulting from interventions.	Blinding
First, the double-blinding procedure could have been implemented in the case of the comorbidity trial but would not be required for retrospective results (Table 1).	Blinding
A clinical team could have also blinded patients by applying a questionnaire to each individual's file.	Blinding
Some of the patients who received a transcutaneous catheter were blinded to the intervention (e.g., a physician was omitted from the intervention, which could have affected the physiology of the patient, or were blinded to a person who received the injection, for example).	Blinding
As a result, it would be difficult to accurately predict a patient’s self-medication response without blinding, and the study staff could not readily anticipate if these participants were self-aware of their responses.	Blinding
The study design was not blind to participants, but it could be useful to determine how participants might be blinded to their intervention by viewing the treatment booklet.	Blinding
Furthermore, we were unable to obtain blood or urine analyses of healthy subjects with a comorbid condition in both arms, due to the short follow-up time and the inability to obtain blood or urine samples.	MissingData
In addition, we did not have access to serum triglycerides (a significant limitation in a prospective study).	MissingData
The data for the CNS were very limited because of a lack of follow-up.	MissingData
In addition, missing data from non-response rates may reflect a lack of concern for the safety of the trial (i.e., lack of adequate evaluation of outcome measures in the CDE study).	MissingData
Additionally, we could not obtain total patient response.	MissingData
Another limitation of the study is that participants were not contacted as regularly as they should have been.	MissingData
The sample size in our second study was not large enough to reflect a substantial difference in study participation.	MissingData
The potential limiting factor was that we could not collect data on how many participants completed each course, mainly resulting in a limitation in the study design.	MissingData
Second, a lack of enrolment data reflects the lower level of motivation to complete the trial compared to patients who entered it.	MissingData
In addition to the clinical parameters, a significant proportion of patients dropped out of the study in the post-analysis.	MissingData
A second reason for the high level of dropouts was that we did not obtain a copy of the blood glucose levels of patients enrolled in the intervention.	MissingData
The high level of asymmetry between the two groups might be due to the high proportion of the first and second randomizations.	MissingData
Because of this lack of information, it is not possible to interpret the underlying reasons for the high number of non-responders, or how this could be explained.	MissingData
The lack of follow-up of patients in the ERCA study may have contributed to a lower number of participants in the ERCA study than in the URCA study.	MissingData
Another limitation is the short duration of follow-up at the end of the study.	MissingData
Despite our randomized designs, a substantial effect of non-random factors on study occurrence was present in some participants and there was no evidence of non-random effects in this study, and thus there is a potential for the potential bias in the final results.	Randomization
Furthermore, the absence of a two-arm randomization in the second arm of the study and the fact that the arms were not randomised was due to confounding between treatment groups and, as a result, bias in the data analysis.	Randomization
The difference between the two study arms in patient care with bacterial infections was significant and may be explained by the fact that the patients in the trial remained unchanged despite randomisation.	Randomization
However, this bias was due to nonrandomised effects and a possible missing link in the selection of patients.	Randomization
Although randomization tended to be more rigorous, the presence of a significant confounding factor in the results of each group in the primary analysis was not explained by the relatively high level of covariates in the two studies.	Randomization
Although the randomization groups in this study are similar, differences among treatment groups are greater (explained below).	Randomization
However, the randomization procedure involved in our study was more complicated than in the other trials, and the data could not be significantly different.	Randomization
Because patients with diabetes had significantly different weights, randomization tended to favour younger patients, but it was unclear why the difference was so large.	Randomization
Although it is interesting that all patients were randomized to bpgc (although not all patients had significant bpc).	Randomization
The osmotic pressure-strain study with no treatment arm was more reliable and less inconvenient than the group treated with osmotic pulse-strain.	Randomization
In addition, although the two patients were randomized in the same manner, there were no randomisation errors.	Randomization
While there were several other treatment variables, none of them were used in this study, so the final effect of the treatment effects was different.	Randomization
In addition, a large difference between the groups of patients was observed in the number of patients in the randomized study.	Randomization
Because of the small sample size, we found that the proportion of patients with ophthalmic malformations in the two groups was significantly different from each other in this study, and that the two groups were not randomised separately in the enzymatic infusion protocol, but that a large part of the variation was due to variability in ophthalmic fracture rate.	Randomization
Thus, although the main effects of the two randomization groups were different between groups, the outcome analysis in this group was similar.	Randomization
Although we could provide some information regarding baseline baseline BMI, we had limited data on ambulatory ECG in the study.	MissingData
As there was no data collection of relapses in the second half of the trial, these were related to the limitation of the assessment of therapeutic effects of dihydroepiandrosterone.	MissingData
We are not aware of any other missing data at the time of clinical assessment of metabolites in serum -glucuronides and amylase levels.	MissingData
The limited time for assessment of the clinical outcome and the limited time to complete the assessment, as well as a very small number of patients who lost their interest in the study, made it difficult to assess the potential impact of the proposed interventions.	MissingData
The small sample size at enrolment, particularly for study duration, resulted in limited information on study outcomes.	MissingData
As in our study, we could not collect data on the clinical outcome from a clinically relevant study e.g.	MissingData
However, we did not have the ability to identify the percentage of study discontinuations during the follow-up period.	MissingData
We found a significant variation in age, gender, and education during each visit to the center.	MissingData
Notably, a limitation of the trial was the absence of objective assessments of the cognitive function of patients following cesarean section.	MissingData
The primary complication that emerged was the high level of study abandonment and a high rate of inadequacy of follow-up to data collection.	MissingData
A further limitation of our study is the limitation of sample size which made it difficult to characterize sample size for analysis.	MissingData
The nature of this study may have been confounded by the high proportion of participants who did not complete their questionnaires in all arms.	MissingData
It was difficult to conclude that the use of a novel drug in a single intervention has a significant impact on the outcomes, but it may have been limited because of the high proportion of participants whose serum urogenital hormones had been changed in a manner comparable to the usual dose of medicine.	MissingData
Another limitation is the very low percentage of patients who were unable to be recruited as a secondary prevention intervention, especially after the completion of the second reassessment.	MissingData
We did not report any of these non-compulsory adverse events after completion of the study.	MissingData
The elongation of the study was mainly based on the presence of lithium in patients, but the longer time to cure was sufficient to identify significant improvement in symptoms.	StudyDuration
We did not evaluate the long-term effects of nystatin over a three-year period, as this was primarily a non-clinical study.	StudyDuration
However, it would be difficult to establish the effects of a long-term treatment on the long-term risk of death from an acute stroke.	StudyDuration
Second, the treatment period was short; therefore, it might not be possible to evaluate the long-term effects of changes in GBM.	StudyDuration
However, it is still too early to discuss the effects of lithium on qTc levels, because many studies report long duration of benefit.	StudyDuration
Hence, it is difficult to assess the long-term effects of calcium titration on melatonin concentrations (although it could be extended with subsequent visits to the clinic).	StudyDuration
Second, the trial duration did not address the issue of efficacy.	StudyDuration
However, the average follow-up was only 7 months and it was also difficult to conclude a long-term effect on severity of disability in patients with BMI > 0 for long-term retention and for chronic disease progression.	StudyDuration
Second, the 5-year follow-up period may be a limitation of this study.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, although a longer extension of follow-up may be desirable, it may not be feasible to study for the long term.	StudyDuration
The study duration of 6 years is very short but would not have been adequate for assessing the long-term effect on HDD progression.	StudyDuration
Although it is possible to assess the effects of longer term maintenance in patients who suffer from thrombotic colitis (a disease which leads to acute respiratory depression and anxiety), long-term follow-up is not possible.	StudyDuration
This study was conducted for a relatively short time period and would result in the lack of definitive results, given the potential effects of TCA on BMD.	StudyDuration
Second, if we are to determine the long-term effects of these treatments, we would need to see data for a longer period of time to address these important questions.	StudyDuration
The small sample size may have caused premature repercussions of an intervention intervention that was not intended to determine the long-term clinical effects of an intervention, but was intended to observe long-term effects in a single event.	StudyDuration
However, when the study was conducted by a clinically skilled group of patients, the sample had a lower response rate compared to the cohort of patients randomised.	Randomization
Because of the closeness in age between enrolment and withdrawal, we were unable to perform an effective randomisation.	Randomization
However, given the small number of patients in the first group with untreated ectopic pregnancy, randomisation was not feasible, and thus, the difference between patients with untreated pregnancy was not significant.	Randomization
This is because the clinical outcomes from both arm groups differed and the two arms are very similar in size and nature, so there was a difference in mean blood pressure at both arms.	Randomization
Because patients in the second arm of the study were older, the prevalence of anemia in this group was significantly higher than in the first arm.	Randomization
While we have found no significant difference in treatment effects for patients in this group whose diets differed significantly, the large variability in clinical outcomes between the two groups suggests that randomization may have been influenced by both the way patients are randomized and by other factors.	Randomization
However, as our findings were significant in the symptom categories with similar levels of symptom severity, our findings in this analysis show no effect on symptom severity.	Randomization
Due to the small sample size, it was difficult to calculate which patients would benefit from the intervention from which patients did not, and it is difficult to account for this in the reanalysis.	Randomization
However, as randomization between the two studies was not performed, the difference in distributions of risk resulting from exposure to an intravenous drug between the 2 groups was not statistically significant.	Randomization
However, given the nature of this study, we conclude that the patient response may have been more severe than the data reflected by the treatment group.	Randomization
Nonetheless, although the results were consistent, the patient adherence rate for an antidepressant in this group was a little lower than that observed in other patients.	Randomization
Although there was no interaction between patients and their treatment groups, the large number of patients randomized to cigrp (in the absence of crossover effect) may have accounted for some of the differences in the results.	Randomization
However, despite the larger size of the control and larger sample size of the asymptomatic participants, the effect of randomization on the severity of the illness was small.	Randomization
However, despite this variation, the effect on stroke risk was not significant.	Randomization
Although the mean (SD) of all patients in the group who were enrolled in the group with no intraoperative hemorrhage were comparable across groups, the difference between the groups was less, and the primary outcome was more important.	Randomization
Moreover, there are limited data about individual-level exposures for all patients after a course of intervention, which is indicative of the high number of patients who had abandoned the intervention.	MissingData
We had a high proportion of participants who did not complete the follow-up assessment, but our analysis was not sensitive to those variables.	MissingData
We did not have full and complete patient-reported characteristics for each intervention.	MissingData
Third, we did not have an overall average age at randomisation to consider, but this may have contributed to a small number of non-responders to the study.	MissingData
One limitation of this study is that all patients lost during follow-up were interviewed only for symptoms or symptoms.	MissingData
As mentioned above, 5% of patients with serious obstructive pulmonary disease and those with chronic kidney disease were not available for the intervention.	MissingData
Firstly, there was no evaluation of any individual dietary intake in the first half of the intervention.	MissingData
First, in the reanalysis of a prospective study, we could not obtain detailed data on patients with chronic renal disease and associated outcomes.	MissingData
We also did not have a sample of 62 women with diabetes over 24 years of age in either group (reference range = 15–35), and a low proportion of women over 18 years of age had a combined gender-based gender-based age distribution (reference range = 10–14 years).	MissingData
In addition, only 20 participants from the study entered the study on day 3 of the clinical trial.	MissingData
Lastly, it was impossible to obtain a full list of patients who achieved complete clinical outcomes.	MissingData
This may have been due to the high number of participants who did not respond to follow-up, perhaps owing to the lower number of patients in the follow-up group, particularly in the scleroderma arm and a lack of willingness to undergo physical examinations, as suggested by our protocol review.	MissingData
In addition, patients who dropped out of the trial, however, were almost all in the BCG group.	MissingData
It is likely that at the end of the study, all patients with blood glucose levels (B.H.I) were not evaluated.	MissingData
Despite the relatively small number of participants in our study, a substantial proportion had no medical history at the time of surgery.	MissingData
We did not have a time point to collect blood samples of participants aged 18–49 years, which suggests a limit of our capacity to collect clinically relevant data.	MissingData
In addition, there were only 17 out of 20 patients who stopped the study.	MissingData
A limitation is that not all of the ten patients with a history of mental health problems enrolled in the study were available for follow-up after termination of the study.	MissingData
Further, we have fewer observations of the bOther2 encoding level than the COther3 encoding.	MissingData
As a result, we could not assess the patient outcome, but it may be that the low patient participation is due to fear of losing a key partner or due to lack of time.	MissingData
Another limitation of this study is the relatively small number of missing data in the patient outcome.	MissingData
Further, while the sample size was relatively small, a considerable proportion of participants did not have blood pressure measurements, blood glucose levels and blood glucose levels, and a relatively small percentage of patients did not have a pulse or pulse rate monitor, suggesting a larger sample size.	MissingData
We were unable to access all sats taken by our patients, as many had withdrawn at baseline.	MissingData
Second, we did not have access to all patients in the trial.	MissingData
Finally, although our assessment of the overall success rate in the intervention and baseline, we did not have any data on the effects of bp and age of entry in our trial.	MissingData
In addition to our daily dose and the amount of time spent in each ward, there were few people who did not complete the trial, particularly in the second week of each course.	MissingData
In our second study, more than half of the participants had complete or partial response to clinically relevant measures.	MissingData
Further, missing data about body weight were not recorded in the clinical trial.	MissingData
However, there was no information available on the proportion of participants who left the intervention or lost interest in the intervention at follow-up.	MissingData
We are unable to assess the outcome of the study in the absence of a patient observation, thus excluding some of the non-specific characteristics that might have influenced patient choice.	MissingData
Not all patients with an injury or illness in the other groups of IE remained at hospital.	MissingData
In addition, a large proportion of participants did not have a follow-up appointment, probably because of this limitation.	MissingData
Further, as it is a multimodal intervention, a low proportion of participants who completed the first DTRA intervention (assay, and analysis) did not have access to a complete set of vital signs during clinical follow-up.	MissingData
Further, the lack of patient-reported follow-up time could be attributed to the inability to complete the assessment of disease activity.	MissingData
As the outcome was obtained after the completion of the study, there was a substantial amount of follow-up by patients withdrawn from the study.	MissingData
Further, our study is not well-integrated to the large patient cohort randomized to the whole study.	MissingData
We could not obtain an appropriate number of participants (10) and thus were not able to identify baseline levels of sociodemographic or socioeconomic disadvantages in the trial.	MissingData
Furthermore, in the case of the frog control arm, I lacked a comprehensive measure of glucose uptake (pg/dL).	MissingData
In addition, there was no study-level discussion of the effectiveness of encapsulation and the outcome of the intervention.	MissingData
The number of participants not included in the study was limited because our intervention approach imposed a small proportion of randomization (Figure 3.1).	MissingData
We had no follow-up data for any individual with diabetes mellitus after the first symptom, and were unable to follow the patients until 2 weeks after the last symptom, despite the absence of a physical examination, or when the symptoms arose.	MissingData
Another limitation of the study is the relative absence of clinical information for each patient.	MissingData
Furthermore, the spherical needle (spherical cap) and glycerol (glycerocephalus) were not available for any of the subjects who discontinued the study.	MissingData
Another limitation is that a number of dietary and dietary supplement factors in the study may have influenced the number of patients taking a placebo.	MissingData
Moreover, a major limitation of the TNM study was the absence of a questionnaire on gender, age, and dietary intake.	MissingData
Lastly, it was not possible to extend the duration of the trial in the absence of severe cognitive impairment (i.e.	StudyDuration
However, it is difficult to assess treatment effects in this study, so the effect of duration may be more important.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, the length of the trial is very short.	StudyDuration
Additionally, due to the shortness of the duration of the studies we could not observe long-term effect in the ovulatory disease phase of the disease.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of our study was the very short duration of follow-up, with no evidence of any long-term effect on progression to stabilisation in all cases.	StudyDuration
Second, it is unlikely that our six-month extension did not fully capture the benefits of the phenomenological interventions.	StudyDuration
This is another reason why we chose a short-term follow-up period.	StudyDuration
It is a concern that long term follow-up may not be sufficient to assess the effect of glucocorticoids on the risk of toxicity.	StudyDuration
However, at present it is not possible to extend this study beyond 5 years (presumably to exclude the effects of chemotherapy on thrombosis) to evaluate the effect of a longer duration regimen.	StudyDuration
Second, the trial duration was short, a long time to observe significant benefit.	StudyDuration
Finally, the study ended very prematurely after the first half of 2009, whereas early detection would be expected to improve the effect of anti-aging on patients with edema, but only after a few months.	StudyDuration
However, as our study was not long enough to assess the effects of anti-retroviral therapy on chronic pain, we may have to move the study to a longer duration.	StudyDuration
Moreover, it is difficult to establish how long the effect of long-term weight gain lasts when the patient is in stable condition and the average weight of patients in this group falls within the range of healthy individuals.	StudyDuration
However, the duration of the intervention may have been too short to fully capture the effects of long-term tetracycline use.	StudyDuration
As with all studies on anaemia, it would be helpful to investigate the effects of dietary changes over time and subsequently observe any clinical improvement.	StudyDuration
The patient-administration group was not blind to participants’ participation in the study, so it was possible for a small amount of time to accumulate between interventions.	Blinding
In the case of self-administered intervention, a pharmacokinetic interaction between the interventionists and patients is likely to have occurred, but it is difficult to determine whether the observed effects of the drug were unblinded.	Blinding
The administration of the drug would have been partially blinded if the drug administration team were randomized.	Blinding
Therefore, we hypothesized that participants in the RNs would have misinterpreted the outcome and therefore underestimated the impact of intervention.	Blinding
The patient in control arms may not have been blinded to the outcome but was unaware that the clinicians were self-employed and therefore not blinded to outcomes, which would have led to an inherent bias.	Blinding
In the absence of prior informed consent, some researchers would have wanted to double-blind the participants, but this is unlikely.	Blinding
The observation protocol is a single-blind study, and the treatment group may be partially blinded, as the interviewer may have re-used or re-directed some of the interventions for subsequent assessments.	Blinding
A potential unblinding might have occurred if the study group was not blinded to the intervention (see table 1).	Blinding
This observation was not blinded as a study participant was not randomized and would be difficult to identify (assuming there was no obliteration).	Blinding
One potential bias was caused by participant treatment change at the end of the study, such that there may have been a reversal of treatment between the two groups.	Blinding
The results of the intervention were not completely blinded, but a significant bias may have been due to an unknown treatment regimen.	Blinding
The investigators did not consider the possibility that participants in the second-line intervention had a sensitivity to the intervention.	Blinding
Some clinicians would have misinterpreted the outcome measurement at the start of the trial, as in the case of a study participant who referred himself to a specialist during the first week.	Blinding
In addition, an interobserver blinding (e.g., participant blinding) is necessary for the analysis of intraobserver data (which should have been conducted in the same session) and for data collection and analysis.	Blinding
The authors acknowledge that this study did not require a double-blinding.	Blinding
An adverse event might have occurred if the investigators did not completely blind the volunteers, i.e. if they were involved in a study of a patient whose status was progressively worse, for example, if they walked away from the study.	Blinding
Furthermore, because participants are observable by others, this may not have been the case.	Blinding
In addition, the intervention were not blinded by the endpoint operator (the neurologist in charge of the intervention in this study).	Blinding
In addition, the study was not blinded to examiners.	Blinding
First, because the randomized data were not always blinded, some participants with the MRS-ionometry arm might not have performed as well.	Blinding
As this study was delivered to clinicians blinded, bias could have been expected to be low in any particular clinical intervention; however, we do not expect the effects of this to be significant.	Blinding
As a secondary benefit of the Xerox method, a double blind approach to the assessment of self-reported outcomes, however, may have provided the opportunity for more control, resulting in a better understanding of the effect of self-reported outcomes on performance.	Blinding
Another possibility is that participants were not blinded, perhaps because of a more controlled protocol.	Blinding
As such, it is unlikely that participants were blinded to the assessment results.	Blinding
The patient had to be blinded because of the high variability in the intervention.	Blinding
The study team is not blind to the intervention, and there might be some variation in clinical behaviour as a result.	Blinding
We can only speculate whether the observational cohort blinded participants to receive a randomized placebo-controlled study, which could explain the small sample sizes.	Blinding
Although not blind, there was a non-interval-dependent variable based on intervention (e.g., which could be considered as a bias) that may be introduced by the pragmatism questionnaire, which was not blinded.	Blinding
The treatment group was not blinded to the outcome of the intervention, but rather to the results of an observation based on a self-reported questionnaire.	Blinding
This is because the participants were not blinded to the intervention results, which is possible in the absence of participant knowledge.	Blinding
Therefore, as the control group had no direct placebo controls, it would be unlikely that we could detect an adverse change in life expectancy between the active and the placebo arms.	Control
Thus, it would be surprising if some patients would be able to see improvements in their risk.	Control
This control was not used in the study as it had not been designed to assess the impact of the CPR on stroke prevention in the patients.	Control
The control group was selected to provide an active placebo in a placebo effect.	Control
Thus, there is no control compared to the treatment group with which we compared the treatment of this case.	Control
Furthermore, because this study was not followed with either a matched placebo or an active control, we did not assess the impact of the treatment on the overall mortality in the group treated.	Control
In our study, control could be a useful criterion to compare differences between interventions that may differ in importance.	Control
If we had not been given the placebo group, the clinical benefit would not have been as large as it would have been with a placebo group.	Control
In addition to focusing on emphysema control, both treatments were equally important and both treatment groups had the same effects on toxicity.	Control
Therefore we did not include a control group in the original study, nor did we try to prevent the undesirable effects of the treatment alone.	Control
However, it was not possible to select a control arm to compare the effects of NSAIDs on cardiovascular disease risk.	Control
If the patients were not given an active control, then the doses resulting from the 2 randomized controls were used presumably to reduce oxidative stress.	Control
Although the control group consisted of both a healthy control and the sedating one, we could not compare the effects of these 2 intervention strategies as we haven't yet determined the equivalence of our treatment strategies across these groups.	Control
Since it did not include a control arm in this study, the inclusion of a placebo arm was not possible as a result of lack of evidence.	Control
The inclusion of a placebo group may have increased the effect of placebo on control in the intervention, but this may not have had the same effect as in the trial with a group of healthy participants.	Control
A heightened level of c-fos, a common neurotransmitter for BMD, could account for some of the differences in BMD, but such differences could not be predicted.	StatisticalAnalysis
We could not assess multiple factors with the same significance, which may have led to unintended consequences.	StatisticalAnalysis
A further limitation is that we did not statistically analyze the interaction between the two other variables.	StatisticalAnalysis
Although we did not adjust for multiple risk factors (i.e., we did not adjust for multiple prognostic factors) the results might still be significant for some risk factors.	StatisticalAnalysis
Additionally, because we conducted multiple analyses of all participants, this could have influenced outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Further, we did not control for several other factors, which could skew our results, e.g. the type of dementia, age, and family history, which has potential for causing neuronal damage.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, because we conducted multiple tests, we did not test for multiple hypothesis testing of different outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, because we adjusted for multiple factors, our analysis approach could be less robust.	StatisticalAnalysis
Although we did not adjust for multiple outcomes, we could not adjust for other possible associations between BMI, BP and SSI, which is likely to impact SSI.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, our multivariate analysis model may be overly optimistic because we also took into account multiple tests of outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we compared two different intervention groups, one of the assumptions was that the differences in GBR level of age at diagnosis had a greater impact on mortality compared to the other groups.	StatisticalAnalysis
Furthermore, in the analysis of primary outcomes, we did not test for other factors other than age.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, we had multiple tests for depression, a measure of satiety, and mood swings, which may indicate the influence of stress and anxiety on long-term health outcomes such as diabetes or asthma.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, because we did not test for secondary factors, this finding is more complicated because we also adjusted for multiple outcome measures (one-way or mixed-effects test).	StatisticalAnalysis
One caveat is that we did not conduct a randomized controlled trial to test multiple mechanisms of interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
Our results should not be generalized to other groups of patients in the absence of previous experience with this study, such as adults who have experienced the complications of thrush.	Generalization
We caution against generalising the results of our study outside the U.S.	Generalization
Consequently, we caution that we do not expect the findings to be generalizable to all patients, patients with asymptomatic cardiovascular disease, or to patients with stomatitis.	Generalization
Therefore, the findings may not be generalizable to all patients or to all patients with more severe acute heart disease, but may be applicable to other conditions.	Generalization
Therefore, this study may not be generalizable beyond the setting of the present study.	Generalization
Thus, this approach could be extrapolated to patients with a smaller amount of DHS, or to individuals who have had worse results.	Generalization
The results may not be generalizable to other etiologies and may not apply to individuals with mild asymptomatic depression.	Generalization
Therefore, it is important that the findings in this study are not generalised to patients with uncontrolled diabetes in other settings, because the results can only be applied to individuals with acute non-insulin-dependent stroke.	Generalization
This limitations on generalization may be due to a limitation of generalizing the study into other patients with similar characteristics.	Generalization
However, it may be useful to refer to the study results only for the study of patient with diabetes or high blood pressure.	Generalization
The findings that apply to our study may not be generalisable to all patients, primarily due to the fact that the study only evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes.	Generalization
A larger number of participants with non-stroke heart disease could be inferred from our data based on the results obtained at the CIMMYT study.	Generalization
The results discussed here are specific to the rat model and therefore may not extend to other human organ systems.	Generalization
Finally, as our results may be different in the in vitro setting, the results may not be applicable in a large group of other cardiovascular conditions.	Generalization
Therefore, the findings from this study are not generalizable to other settings and methods, or to non-hospital settings.	Generalization
Given the lack of control intervention in this study, it is difficult to determine whether the intervention would be effective in establishing causal relationships and the effects on mortality would be comparable between groups.	Control
As such, a placebo was not added to the experiment to control for treatment-related disease.	Control
By excluding a control, it was not possible to compare the effect of the treatment with that of the control.	Control
As part of our clinical trial, we also selected a control arm to reduce the potential benefit of a single drug intervention, which is aimed at assessing the potential for long-term anti-retroviral effects in individuals with non-retroviral symptoms.	Control
Using placebo in our study was not feasible because the aim was to evaluate the effect of treatment on preventing strokes.	Control
In addition to the treatment dose, no control was added to achieve the comparison aims of our trial.	Control
As we had not included a control arm, it is not possible to assess whether the current study with a randomized controlled trial of rhodamine in the arm arm of the ASC was appropriate to the individual requiring it.	Control
Therefore, a control arm of our trial was therefore not included in this trial as it was not possible to compare clinical and laboratory outcomes of a treatment in isolation with a placebo arm.	Control
We did not treat all patients with a control arm.	Control
As neither group participated in the experiment in this study, this omission may have resulted in a higher chance of injury in these individuals.	Control
The control regimen was not used because it was less invasive in the treatment of thigh fractures compared to the arms of the group treated.	Control
As neither the regiment was randomized to a controlled placebo group, it seems appropriate to evaluate whether the effects of both interventions were greater in the control group.	Control
Furthermore, our control arm was excluded from the study because it was not suitable for the assessment of treatment effects of this intervention.	Control
In this study, it is difficult to assess the clinical significance of either of the conditions used in this study, because there was no placebo group included, and hence no evidence of any effect on treatment efficacy from the inclusion of either group.	Control
In this study we used a placebo group to control for changes in blood pressure and blood pressure caused by stress and were unable to detect an effect of glycerol in control participants, which is the rationale for including a placebo group.	Control
The absence of primary objective measures of cognitive impairment in adolescent women resulting in poorer performance in the primary and secondary follow-ups, as well as the presence of psychosocial and psychopharmacological distress in adult women, suggested that the study did not adequately address physiological and psychological factors associated with stress or depression.	MissingData
Another limitation of our study was that our aim was to obtain only aggregated outcome data at the end of the study.	MissingData
We had no information on BMI or age at baseline, and there was no information about BMI at time of asymptomatic onset, or any other cause of symptomatic onset, or the frequency of bruising (as an indicator of disease severity) at baseline.	MissingData
This limitation arises from our lack of detailed follow-up data on baseline symptoms, sleep duration and weight.	MissingData
The main limitation of the current trial was the very small number of subjects who dropped out of the study.	MissingData
The study did not include any physical examination, and no follow-up to assess the outcome.	MissingData
We were not able to obtain vitals for the patients in the sham-arm.	MissingData
We also had negative results regarding some co-morbidities reported in the study, but this is likely to have been attributed to the large number of participants missing study doses in this cohort.	MissingData
A further limitation to the TWIST-T study was that data were not available for 5 of the 10 participants.	MissingData
Further, the evaluative data of our trial were not comprehensive and varied across subjects, hence, we could not determine the number of participants who participated in the trial.	MissingData
In addition, the loss of complete follow-up is likely to be related to the short-term nature of the trial.	MissingData
Given the high proportion of patients who opted out of the study, we are unable to make a decision as to the potential effect of treatment on future adverse events or on the level of care and treatment needed.	MissingData
Moreover, it is unlikely that the lower response rate from women in this group could be related to this negative experience.	MissingData
To this end, patients were not registered in any of the two sigmas (as far as the number of sigmas can be measured).	MissingData
There was an increased tendency to drop out of the RESEARCH-ATTID ROC trial, which reflects the absence of follow-up in these two trials.	MissingData
Lastly, since we evaluated our results in the United States, the findings may not apply to other non-U.S. participants (for example, patients with advanced kidney disease and those with an acute or chronic condition with acute kidney disease).	Generalization
It is important that the results used here may not be generalizable to other conditions, as they do not include all patients with NTN.	Generalization
The findings of our study may not be generalisable to other clinical settings, resulting in generalization limits.	Generalization
This results may be interpreted in different settings, and may affect the generalisability of the study.	Generalization
Hence the use of the BPAC may have limitations in generalising this conclusion to the population of patients with chronic kidney disease or other chronic disease, as the findings in this study are specific to the BPAC study.	Generalization
This means that the conclusions from our study may not be generalizable to other populations.	Generalization
Therefore, the results from this study may not be applicable to all patients with CID.	Generalization
As such, the findings can be generalized to other countries.	Generalization
Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to all patients and would require further research to assess generalizability of the results.	Generalization
Our results can be only applied to our own patients because our study only focused on intravenous drug administration.	Generalization
Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to the patient population of which the septicaemia study is based.	Generalization
Our results must therefore be generalized to patients with septicemia.	Generalization
Consequently, the results of the study may not be applicable to individuals whose clinical condition is associated with risk factors for suicide, primarily due to the fact that they differ significantly from those of the participants studied.	Generalization
The findings might be generalized to the broader population but only if they are made by a trained specialist in a standardized setting.	Generalization
Therefore, a dose change in healthy adults may also have an effect on adults with a history of asthma (e.g.	Generalization
The present study was non-blinded, which explains the resulting increased level of observable variation in the utilisation of intravenous drug injections.	Blinding
Furthermore, blinding could have arisen if the clinicians had been blinded to the type of intervention they were receiving, such as the acupuncture intervention.	Blinding
The aim of the study was to assess the potential effects of acupuncture treatment on cognitive ability in young adults with neuromuscular disorders, but as usual the participants were blinded to the effects of treatment.	Blinding
The use of blinded protocols is not possible because the participants were not blinded to their interventions.	Blinding
The investigators may have been partially unblinded by participants receiving a non-randomised treatment.	Blinding
The study participants were not blinded to their behavioural characteristics, making measurement of participant responses in this study more difficult and subsequently less predictable, as is the case in this study.	Blinding
The treatment team was not blind to the outcomes, e.g., whether volunteers had or had not had a coma.	Blinding
It is not known if the intervention team was blinded, as there may have been significant patient asymmetry, or if the study design was a bit different.	Blinding
Because participants were not blinded, the study might not have been as well designed in this way.	Blinding
The blinding of the pharmacovigilance team to the randomized intervention was unanticipated and the outcome would have been different.	Blinding
It is unclear whether the intervention was blinded, and the data of blinded participants (as measured by a self-report form) may have been filtered to account for the presence of self-reported patients.	Blinding
Another issue would have been the possibility of a second intervention by the registrars, possibly because patients have been blinded by their patients.	Blinding
Consequently, the researchers did not blind participants.	Blinding
In the event of a blinding error, this may have resulted from participants not identifying individual interventions as being performed independently, but not blinding the study to the intervention.	Blinding
Firstly, some participants may have questioned the validity of the outcome measures as to their intention to receive the intervention.	Blinding
Participants were recruited in large samples and in non-trivial groups, such as naive adults.	StudyDesign
The pilot design involved both a large and small number of participants and was a trial, which might have consequences for outcomes assessment.	StudyDesign
A randomization was initiated with the intention of determining the effects of randomization on patient satisfaction in a simple, randomised setting.	StudyDesign
In addition, our study was not designed to support the production of a comprehensive report, and thus there was no opportunity for the development of a final report or other publications.	StudyDesign
A study with a small sample size is likely to be more complex than a clinical trial in its ability to assess and manage risk factors for clinical trial failure.	StudyDesign
The small scale nature of the study requires it to include several arms and thus not allow for trial design to be analyzed.	StudyDesign
Cross-sectional trials are complicated and may have confounding effects.	StudyDesign
First, the study was non-randomized and primarily noncomparative.	StudyDesign
Moreover, while it is difficult to determine the underlying motivation and causal mechanisms, we recognize that we must consider how the trial is conducted and its implications for future studies.	StudyDesign
Because of the large sample size, the need for a clinical trial was secondary, the results were asymmetric.	StudyDesign
A study with a high number of covariates is challenging to implement.	StudyDesign
Third, while we could have incorporated some exclusion criteria, we chose to not use these in the reanalysis phase.	StudyDesign
Another limitation is the use of closed-label, no-decision-making study design.	StudyDesign
In addition, we assessed the feasibility of our proposed design and used exploratory analyses to analyze the impact of the intervention on risk assessment in the treatment group and at the endpoint.	StudyDesign
We also wanted to test the feasibility of randomization and to determine the effects of cluster effects on overall health.	StudyDesign
Our findings might not be generalizable to other patients with CNV.	Generalization
Therefore, our findings cannot be generalized to other clinical trials in the same study group.	Generalization
Therefore, it is essential that the findings are applied to patients with uncomplicated and congenital bleeding and to individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury.	Generalization
Consequently, our findings can only be transferred to patients with clinically established diabetes.	Generalization
Therefore, the current findings of the NIH VCP should be interpreted with caution as specific to the study group concerned.	Generalization
This finding has a very specific application to the clinical management of asymptomatic type 2 diabetes.	Generalization
This limit the generalizability of our findings to a broader sample.	Generalization
Finally, the use of our results has a limitation in that it may not be generalizable outside of our clinic.	Generalization
In the future, therefore, the results presented in this report may not be applicable to patients with other inflammatory conditions, or to patients with uncomplicated cardiovascular disease.	Generalization
The results of this study may not be generalizable to other populations or circumstances.	Generalization
Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to the larger sample of patients in the general population.	Generalization
Therefore, the generalizability of the findings here may not be completely consistent with the results of the trial, which were conducted on adults with and without an acute chest cold.	Generalization
Finally, because we designed our study in a clinical context, we cannot ensure that our findings extend beyond our study population.	Generalization
Finally, the findings might not be generalizable to all populations, which means that the results of our study may not be generalizable to all patients.	Generalization
The study results are therefore limited and may not be generalizable to patients in other populations.	Generalization
Since the sample sizes were similar in all four groups, this conclusion is consistent with the finding that non-randomised trials are the most common (as determined by the corresponding number of randomised outcomes).	Randomization
Furthermore, although it is possible that some of the clinically relevant comorbid conditions may have been a result of randomisation, other patients with similar or slightly comorbid conditions might have experienced increased disease burden in the postnatal period and may be more likely to develop symptoms of comorbid conditions.	Randomization
Although a number of patient characteristics were significantly different, the proportion of patients who took part in CPR increased by 8%.	Randomization
The presence of an important complication in this study may have been due to the very large number of patients randomly allocated in this study.	Randomization
However, a larger number of patients were not randomised.	Randomization
A limitation of this study was that patients with MTS were randomised to receive either a dose of GLP-3 or GLP-C (e.g., at the time of initiation) rather than the standard dose of GLP.	Randomization
In contrast to the randomization of PBT, randomized clinical trial participants with more than 10 years’ experience with the drug were randomized using a more conservative method and patients with more frequent visits.	Randomization
While the study was randomised based on baseline variables, differences in the number of patients randomized among the two groups would have been large in magnitude.	Randomization
A significant effect of baseline stress and fatigue on the clinical outcomes was found for patients with diabetes in the NS versus the CN, but this effect may not have contributed to the observed clinical differences.	Randomization
Our study had a significant effect on treatment outcomes, but this effect was not statistically significant, so our comparison was not an error-free randomisation.	Randomization
Because we used three randomised arms in the comparison group, we did not have a comparison arm whose random effects are similar in size or distribution.	Randomization
However, an unobservable difference in patients receiving CVC after post-operative period dilated anemia between arms was observed in the first study and it may have been due to bias in the initial allocations.	Randomization
Further, we found that the proportions of participants with the worst outcome from the equine anemia tended to be higher in the equine anemia group than in the standard anemia group.	Randomization
However, this study was not randomised.	Randomization
Because of these differences, the analysis of the group of patients with chronic illness did not account for the presence of chronic pain in the study.	Randomization
In addition to the study design limitations, it was possible to use unblinded recruitment in order to assess effects of socioeconomic factors and a variety of outcomes.	StudyDesign
Interventions such as blinding and clustering are more suited to small studies as they require less control of recruitment and distribution.	StudyDesign
In a more pragmatic fashion, we are interested in reducing the number of participants, thus limiting the ability to analyze dietary intake and outcomes.	StudyDesign
Our design was exploratory in nature, and participants could not be randomized.	StudyDesign
The study protocol required both a pilot-like sample size and a randomized intervention for recruitment and was not designed to test for evaluability.	StudyDesign
The exploratory design imposed by the inclusion of a control group was also challenging in terms of achieving the desired end point, namely the adoption of a randomised controlled trial with no formal formal results.	StudyDesign
Our study was not intended to be a formal clinical trial, as we did not wish to create a formal clinical trial design to control for site-specific differences.	StudyDesign
A pragmatic design is required to understand the study design and the efficacy of the study but there is a potential for some flexibility in reporting results.	StudyDesign
Because we evaluatively examined both randomised and non-randomized interventions, we were unable to establish a formal study design.	StudyDesign
This trial was limited in its design and we were unable to use clustering.	StudyDesign
A feasibility study is necessary to test a potential confounding effect of uncontrolled clinical trials and to address the question of whether a randomised controlled trial can be used.	StudyDesign
We have limited capacity to make final site decisions on efficacy or safety, and therefore the study was not designed to allow for the use of pre-tests or data aggregation.	StudyDesign
Additionally, the study was limited in its aims to explore the feasibility and feasibility of evaluative methods, resulting in the need to implement a single-centre design.	StudyDesign
Randomized controlled trials can be difficult to implement because they allow for the evaluation of unbounded hypothesis testing as well as the possibility of making assumptions about the clinical effect.	StudyDesign
In the final analysis, we had to restrict us to trial designs to a maximum of 2 study conditions.	StudyDesign
By comparing the COR in both groups we were able to evaluate our intervention effect and to determine whether COR was useful in the context of this study.	Control
Therefore, our control arm did not include any active drug in the intervention as a control.	Control
By not including an active control, the effect of this drug was not assessed.	Control
Although not in clinical trials, the use of a placebo is a clear indication that this drug was well tolerated.	Control
We therefore compared this control with the active control which could have been more appropriate to include in the trial but was not feasible in the clinical trials.	Control
Its use as a control did not appear to be advisable because it had a larger impact on outcomes than a non-randomized control and thus was more likely to have a larger effect.	Control
In this study, neither of the groups tested was considered as a control, implying that neither was part of the dose-rating for the trial.	Control
We therefore concluded that if an alternative treatment modality was selected then the positive effects of this intervention could be reduced with the addition of a control.	Control
Therefore, neither control or arms in this trial lacked a clear goal for clinical trials.	Control
In the absence of a control in the clinical trial, the use of a placebo arm would have been inconclusive since this arm was not assessed and the arm had a much smaller volume of work.	Control
Therefore, it is not possible to compare the effectiveness of different treatment arms.	Control
As the control arm was not effective in this experiment, it is difficult to say if the treatment provided in the original study was appropriate.	Control
However, since it was important for the outcome, the choice of an active control group would be a positive step towards modifying the therapeutic intervention.	Control
In addition, no control group was assessed in the trial and thus no control group in the trial could be used to assess clinical effects or to compare outcomes.	Control
Alternatively, it is possible that the experimental intervention was different, and thus more effective, when compared with a control condition.	Control
It is unclear whether a bias in treatment allocation or data interpretation were achieved at study end.	Blinding
We have not determined whether participants were blinded to a given group of patients.	Blinding
However, as mentioned above, the behavioural assessment was not blinded, hence a potential bias in treatment bias is unlikely.	Blinding
In addition, it may be relevant to consider whether participants were blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
The use of two different groups of patients with similar goals to the neonatal groups (unknown or unknown) is expected to have some influence on results, but the study is likely to be unblinded.	Blinding
In addition, the results of the study may have been subject to some unblinding.	Blinding
Were the data obtained from the same study to be double-blinded, there would be an increase in bias because of the high proportion of patients who viewed it as a ‘blinding’.	Blinding
It is also possible that some of the participants were blinded to the outcomes of the intervention (e.g.	Blinding
A second, potential additional bias might be present if the nurses are double-blinded, as could be the case in the absence of participants reporting their gender.	Blinding
In addition, participants in the unblinded acuity group (as determined by the clinician) may have been unable to accurately predict their treatment responses if they had not completed the study.	Blinding
Nevertheless, participants could be more unaware of their results when they returned home to attend a post-intervention follow-up visit, especially if the patient remained with the same treatment regimen as before.	Blinding
The presence of a treatment blinding could have resulted from a sample size variation, resulting in an unexpected lag in response time and thus a high incidence of treatment failures.	Blinding
One possibility of the blinding effect was that the aortic valves on the back of the trachea were truncated.	Blinding
The presence of a study manager may have led to different outcomes and treatment strategies, which can be further complicated if participants are not blinded to the intervention they are receiving.	Blinding
This may have been due to the treatment group not being blinded.	Blinding
Third, since the results of this study were limited to pulmonary and peripheral arterial disease, they cannot be generalized to acute stroke.	Generalization
Therefore, the results from this study could not be extended to other patients in the NHA group with BP of less than 2%.	Generalization
We believe the results presented here may not be generalizable to patients with chronic BP based on the specific effects of ibuprofen or ibuprofen treatment.	Generalization
This limitation limits our ability to generalize our results to non-surgical patients.	Generalization
The result of this study was made in the US and therefore not universally applicable to other countries.	Generalization
However, in this context, the results of our study were performed in only one clinic – in the U.	Generalization
Finally, as the study was performed at a hospital, the findings of the study are relevant only to the hospital where we operated.	Generalization
First, given the limited sensitivity of our study to acute or chronic illnesses, it is important that our findings are carried out in the context of an acute disease.	Generalization
The results from this study may not be generalizable to other populations.	Generalization
Third, we note that the outcome of the study in our study may not have been generalizable to all adults with pulmonary embolism.	Generalization
Second, the results may not be generalizable to patients with other chronic conditions such as malaria and rheumatoid arthritis.	Generalization
Therefore, in light of the limitations in the present study, we cannot draw conclusions from the results of the study in terms of the generalisation.	Generalization
A major limitation of this finding is that this findings cannot be generalized to other populations, and the data analyzed by the GMS may not be generalizable to all cases.	Generalization
In this sense, our results cannot be extrapolated to conditions that might have effect on the patients we studied (such as high-risk patients with diabetes, stroke, or hypertension).	Generalization
The generalisability of our results is limited by the fact that some differences in the outcomes among patients with undiagnosed renal disease and those with idiopathic renal disease (including patients with idiopathic renal disease) can be seen among patients with undiagnosed renal disease and those with undiagnosed renal disease.	Generalization
A limitation of our data collection was that we did not report a specific pharmacokinetic profile for all medications and we did not collect blood pressure or glucose measurements.	MissingData
To assess any potential bias in the primary outcome, our clinical care team did not contact me regarding the impact of the interventions on lifestyle, but I did have contact with a number of individuals with chronic respiratory infections.	MissingData
We also lacked complete physical examinations and were not able to obtain blood or urine samples.	MissingData
Moreover, the absence of dietary intake data was a limitation of this trial, partly because it was difficult to estimate the number of adults in the study (i.e., the effect of diet on disease severity) and partly because the sample size of these measurements was small.	MissingData
In addition, our results from the CRISPS trial did not provide sufficient information to support a statistical analysis.	MissingData
In this study, the absence of complete patient data (e.g., demographic characteristics, duration of illness, daily glucose and glucose).	MissingData
Another limitation of the current study was the lack of time and/or frequency of data entry.	MissingData
Moreover, some of the participants left during the primary and secondary analyses did not meet eligibility criteria for the cohort follow-up questionnaires.	MissingData
The study group did not provide a final report of any adverse effects.	MissingData
Although we collected data on oestrogen levels during the course of each treatment, the lack of adequate follow-up is significant, and we have been unable to determine the causal impact of weight loss.	MissingData
A further limitation is the high rate of discontinuation for the DMARD trials resulting in a significant decrease in follow-up.	MissingData
Additionally, the lack of additional follow-up from the relapsed patients may be due to a lack of interest.	MissingData
In addition, patients who stopped taking the trial because of a lack of interest in the study were not eligible for follow-up at baseline.	MissingData
Similarly, fewer than half of participants had a history of diabetes and some were not able to make a diagnosis of diabetes.	MissingData
As the primary outcome measurement, the potential bias is mitigated by the lower number of patients in the trial, as these participants were not enrolled in the intervention, so it remains possible that these missing data can be related to the limited sample size.	MissingData
An experimenter would not be blinded to a prospective cohort, nor to a pre-treatment questionnaire, but a clinician would be unblinded to a follow-up questionnaire.	Blinding
The participants might have been more cautious in the use of BCG enema if they had received either an ELISA (a single dose equivalence-randomized controlled trial), or their intervention could have been modified to minimise the possible impact of the double dose.	Blinding
In this case, participants were not blinded to the outcomes received in this study and hence it is unknown how much bias a small number of volunteers suffered.	Blinding
First, an unexpected drop in the mean serum albumin level in patients who were administered the BT CLI had been noted but not accounted for in the study.	Blinding
Finally, the participants were not blinded to the outcome of the intervention.	Blinding
In this study, the primary interventionist could have been blinded to the treatment.	Blinding
A participant may have been blinded to his or her treatment (perhaps by taking a larger number of interventions) if they had been self-blinded.	Blinding
One limitation was that participants were not blinded, and the methodological design and approach employed by the study team could have been influenced by the presence of a self-assessment instrument.	Blinding
In addition, the use of a blinded questionnaire during the intervention can be harmful to the participant, as an individual might choose to evade the questionnaire, which was the main purpose of this study.	Blinding
The participants may have been blinded to the initial treatment or to the intervention itself but it is not impossible to detect a pattern in baseline changes resulting from the use of a standardised treatment protocol.	Blinding
One method for avoiding double blinding is ensuring that the study subjects were not blinded to their intervention.	Blinding
The intervention may have been performed by clinicians who provided a full-time equivalent of the study.	Blinding
A potential further challenge could have been that participants’ perception of the intervention had not changed after the intervention.	Blinding
The patient-reported behaviour at the end of the peri-intervention remained unchanged, but a non-blinding study design might have limited the number of participants randomized, which is expected to exacerbate the issue.	Blinding
Moreover, participants in the second phase may have been unblinded to their intervention, and the second phase was potentially blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
A potential risk of stoma transmission would be minimal because participants were not blinded to the intervention group they participated in, or because the interventions were administered in two randomized controlled trials.	Blinding
A blinding event is not expected to be performed because participants are not blinded to the study instrument.	Blinding
However, the study was not blinded to study results by one study manager.	Blinding
The corresponding results would have been different in a double-blind setting, as participants could not be blinded to their interventions.	Blinding
The clinicians may have also been blinded to the type of intervention received and subsequently decided to self-report.	Blinding
The blinded intervention would have been avoided had the authors chosen not to offer a randomised vs unblinded protocol.	Blinding
In addition, participants and their clinicians were not blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
As this was a single group study, however, the outcomes were not blinded.	Blinding
Secondly, a potential bias would have been introduced if the participants were unaware of the interventions (e.g.	Blinding
It is also possible that some of the participants may not have been blinded to which leads to a potential recurrence of bleeding in patients with less complication.	Blinding
The interventionists were not blinded to participants' assessment of comorbidity or other factors (or both).	Blinding
The use of a self-administered intervention might not have been blinded, but the presence of the self-administered interventions could have reduced the effect of the blinding procedure.	Blinding
Second, participants may have been blinded to the treatment regimen, resulting in a distorted picture of the outcomes of the intervention.	Blinding
Some participants in the otoplasty cohort were unblinded.	Blinding
An additional effect of double-blinding could arise if participants received an alternative to double-blinding or the HCMV remained unblinded.	Blinding
Second, long-term follow-up was necessary to demonstrate the effects of metformin therapy on postpartum symptoms.	StudyDuration
The 8-week duration of our clinical trial was too short for us to assess the effects of medication and drug adherence on patient symptoms.	StudyDuration
However, it might be prudent to extend the trial to 6 months or 2 years to see whether a significant effect would be seen in managing the chronic fatigue.	StudyDuration
Second, in the case of the BCG group, a trial containing shorter time to respond to treatment would be necessary, to determine the effects of treatment on adverse effects.	StudyDuration
We also found that the study was not sufficiently long to assess the effect of changes in body weight and to allow for any long-term follow-up of treatment effects, thereby limiting the effect of long-term follow-up on the outcome of the toxicity study.	StudyDuration
Secondly, the period in which treatment begins for chronic osteoporosis is relatively short, and only 3 years later, there is no evidence that is supported by long-term follow-up.	StudyDuration
The study had to be terminated early due to the long duration of study, which might have been necessary because of the time lag, but there are no guarantees that the effects of these medications last beyond the first 2 years.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, the duration of the trial may not be long enough to reveal long-term effects on brain-related diseases like cancer.	StudyDuration
This limitation may have led to an extended follow-up after 2 years, as there are no formal reports on long-term outcome.	StudyDuration
Perhaps longer-term follow-up would be needed to assess the impact of an effective treatment in this condition.	StudyDuration
The only significant limitation of our study is the time frame during which we reported any major changes in HDL (i.e.	StudyDuration
However, the follow-up period of three months is too short to assess long-term impact on long-term change in BMI, which could be considered as a cause of the slow decline in BMI.	StudyDuration
Second, it is hard to predict the onset of true clinical effect over a long period of time but this is possible because the duration of the study is too short.	StudyDuration
A shorter trial duration could help explain the success of the anti-aging drug hyaluronic acid in treating chronic pain, which can be a powerful therapy for treating pain.	StudyDuration
Finally, our follow-up was only for 4 weeks, and this is longer than a yearly follow-up period allowing for treatment follow-up of long-term acute anorexia.	StudyDuration
We found that participants were not able to provide a detailed history of diabetes or weight gain in the lds.	MissingData
Additionally, the low proportion of participants who were not willing to complete an initial assessment of clinical responses is not surprising.	MissingData
Additionally, we were unable to collect data on any patient who was enrolled in both intervention arm studies (i.e., all patients with known health conditions in the intervention arm).	MissingData
The lack of secondary outcomes in the other two trials contributes to the limitation that participants who withdraw from the study (e.g., who develop symptoms, who die of stroke or who have died during therapy) do not report any changes in clinical outcome or clinical symptoms.	MissingData
In addition to the data available for all study arms, some adverse events were noted, such as acute fatigue, severe depression and insomnia.	MissingData
In addition, we did not obtain any other information related to blood pressure, pulse rate, or serum insulin concentrations after completion of the study, which could have influenced the size of the evaluative findings.	MissingData
Secondly, although we collected valuable information from a variety of assessments, we only had about 11% of participants from the TID group.	MissingData
Although the analysis of a total of 22 samples was able to identify an estimated 95% of the accumulated weight loss, this would have led to more systematic losses of weight in a controlled setting.	MissingData
The large number of participants lost during follow-up (n = 8) and to follow-up (n = 6) were significant in the context of patient characteristics and psychosocial outcomes.	MissingData
As this study lacked additional data, the clinical outcome of the trial might have impacted on the choice of intervention.	MissingData
First, the clinical effects of the intervention on clinical outcomes were not reported in the trial, a limitation due to the lack of information on patients’ daily activities.	MissingData
A more specific analysis of ocular activity in NIH PHARMAC is needed.	MissingData
Given the nature of our studies we have not been able to follow up on all randomized data obtained in this cohort.	MissingData
Moreover, a small proportion of participants dropped out of the study after three months.	MissingData
Second, although a substantial proportion of participants had completed the whole study, patients had a shorter time period of follow-up (in terms of visits to doctor).	MissingData
Another limitation was that we did not have time to collect biochemical markers in each participant, and these markers have become important factors influencing clinical outcomes.	MissingData
Although we could not provide any quantitative information, some of the missing data were significant (including number of participants enrolled).	MissingData
We also have little or no time for follow-up, because of limitations in the availability of questionnaires and potential limitations in the availability of questionnaire responses.	MissingData
In addition, some of the data were not accessible to investigators at baseline, namely i.e.	MissingData
Secondly, a limitation of our trial design is that patients were excluded from the study if they developed adverse outcomes despite a history of positive results.	MissingData
Moreover, in addition to the baseline data, missing data were reported in the patient-reported and data-pointed variables, but only from the blood, skin and urine, but not from systolic blood pressure (Figure 2).	MissingData
Because of the nature of the trial, there is limited availability of detailed patient demographics and characteristics of the patients in the trial, which may account for the large number of missing patients.	MissingData
An additional limitation is the low percentage of participants who voluntarily took part in the study.	MissingData
A limitation to this study is that the patient data were missing and the proportions of participants excluded from the assessment are significantly lower than the number of patients in the control group.	MissingData
Third, some of the patients who completed the study failed to register their loss of daily calcium intake after completion of their study.	MissingData
Additionally, as described above, the study design has implications for its inclusion of specific outcomes in the GWATT-2 study.	MissingData
In the second arm, the lack of additional phenotypic characteristics and physical examination (particularly at baseline) contributed to a relatively high number of missing measurements.	MissingData
One limitation was that it was not possible to collect the total number of participants in the study who responded to the survey and that the participants enrolled in the study were not followed up for any time period thereafter.	MissingData
Our first limitation was the fact that our patients could not be reached at baseline and, therefore, we lacked the time to conduct a follow-up assessment.	MissingData
The lack of data collection in the first three years of participation from the first group of patients is a consequence of the lack of follow-up.	MissingData
First, patients who left the study did not report in the health-reported outcomes or in asymptomatic symptoms.	MissingData
It is also surprising that more than 50 percent of participants did not report their health status at baseline.	MissingData
Further, it was difficult to obtain an accurate diagnosis of disease-related cardiovascular events based on baseline measurements.	MissingData
Although the clinical data were atypical for a placebo controlled intervention, it may be important to consider the influence of this variable on outcome, as the number of patients with atypical results may be larger than one would expect, and to consider the reasons for the reduced number of participants.	MissingData
There was a high proportion of participants who failed to complete their study.	MissingData
The evaluative outcomes are largely due to this limiting characteristic, as follow-up data on these participants is limited.	MissingData
Furthermore, we had limited data on patients taking nsn (including heart rate variability).	MissingData
We were unable to identify which study participants had been physically tethered or in a position to be measured.	MissingData
A limitation of the study is that participants did not complete all the laboratory and morphological measures of b-cell levels.	MissingData
The large nascent number of participants in the nascent study, which has a long track record of being cut out of the study, prompted us to examine the presence of nascent disease markers in the DON study.	MissingData
Another limitation of our study is the lack of follow-up data for selected intervention groups and the fact that we did not collect clinical measurements.	MissingData
Nevertheless, we did not have clinical data available at baseline for both men and women and for men aged between 18 and 55 years.	MissingData
However, a lack of follow-up information for the interventional arm of the cohort has limited the number of participants in the group to 7.	MissingData
In addition, we had no data from patients’ pulse and BP measurements, and no detailed analysis was undertaken to determine their total physical fitness.	MissingData
Despite the positive results in asymptomatic patients, we were not able to assess the efficacy and outcome of the sedative-replacement intervention in a systematic manner.	MissingData
Additionally, the study design is dependent on a pragmatic design and therefore a study design is often open-ended.	StudyDesign
Our trial was small and thus it could not be considered a pilot study.	StudyDesign
Because we only assessed a sub-group, it may be difficult to determine the effects of the use of additional intervention groups.	StudyDesign
Although our pilot study was not randomized, we did not use a standard RCT design or have a formal study protocol.	StudyDesign
Another limitation of our study was the need to determine baseline demographic data for each study group.	StudyDesign
A small number of patients with vascular disease have been enrolled in a controlled study and may not have been expected to complete the trial in the future.	StudyDesign
An important limitation of this study was the need for the inclusion of non-controlled clinical trials in our cohort.	StudyDesign
Second, the study was not designed to test a number of assumptions concerning the effectiveness of group randomized controlled trials.	StudyDesign
Our study design was exploratory and therefore it was not possible to apply a formal study design and to restrict enrollment and recruitment to only 20 individuals.	StudyDesign
A study of randomization would not have produced the robust results expected with this study type; this may have resulted from allowing randomization at some points of the study (such as for the symptomatic evaluation of gout in elderly patients, or for the assessment of acute gout in younger patients).	StudyDesign
Secondly, the study design involved the introduction of a randomised control group that had been randomized to placebo for up to 10 years.	StudyDesign
Moreover, while we tried to maintain a small number of arms (n=24), we were unable to reach a final analysis.	StudyDesign
The sample size is small, so it is difficult to determine if the study design is appropriate.	StudyDesign
The exploratory design of the study introduces limitations on feasibility such as the possibility to publish non-randomized, non-experimental randomization trials and to restrict the number of participants to an administrative control group.	StudyDesign
A study design change is difficult and may result in the abolition of a number of the randomised measures.	StudyDesign
In this trial the group was not given additional treatments to maintain their metabolic response.	Control
Furthermore, the lack of an active control in this study in our study suggested that it is unlikely to have had significant effect on the vascular wall permeability.	Control
With this treatment, the control group of the participants received a different treatment – i.e., a “normal” dose of i.e.	Control
In the absence of a placebo control in this trial, it was not possible to determine how important it was to have a placebo in each arm.	Control
However, the current control, which has been described as a comparator, may not be the best indication for this clinical trial.	Control
The control arm was not designed to compare the effects of these interventions, because neither was part of the drug regimen we used in this study.	Control
However, the control arm of the study did not include any patients who had a significant effect.	Control
By not including a control, the data showed that the presence of a control arm in our controlled trial is not related to a change in clinical outcome resulting from this intervention.	Control
As a comparator to determine the beneficial effects of our intervention on all participants, we compared it with a controlled group of non-selective volunteers who were treated with a placebo and with an active control group who were treated with an active placebo.	Control
We have not designed this trial to compare the efficacy and safety of different dietary therapies.	Control
Neither the active nor the unobtrusive treatment was intended to be a replacement therapy, and we therefore could not determine the effect of our intervention in achieving beneficial outcomes for the participants.	Control
Because the primary control used in this study is uncontrolled, it is unlikely that it would be the best control modality for treating CHD or CHD related CHD and would be a more suitable comparator for the use of this study.	Control
As a result of being treated in a different manner than the control group, it is impossible to determine which drug a randomized control group has more positive effect on achieving healthy implantation, in spite of the fact that a randomized placebo group is available for all the experimental diseases associated with peri-operative hemorrhage.	Control
Compared to other similar approaches such as a placebo control, we had no control as the combination of the two groups was randomised.	Control
Therefore, we did not include a control in the study.	Control
Because of the multiple hypothesis test, we did not test for primary and secondary outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
One of the confounding factors that may have altered this analysis is the presence of multiple independent variables that may have explained differences in BMI, despite the absence of a formal endpoint (e.g., p values).	StatisticalAnalysis
Another limitation is that we adjusted our assumption of randomisation (which was set at 0.05) to account for multiple outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, a significant effect of age may be associated with an increase in risk of stroke or heart disease in older adults.	StatisticalAnalysis
Further, due to multiple factors and interactions among those groups, the difference between our results could be due to the lower power of our model to control for multiple outcome variables.	StatisticalAnalysis
A second outcome could have been detected if the interaction test was larger than we had anticipated and the number of patients with chronic illnesses could be small.	StatisticalAnalysis
The interaction model was essentially adjusted for age, but it could be the result of a confounding effect because we controlled for a wide range of variables (such as age, gender, and age) in all tests.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, our secondary analysis was limited to the single effect model; however, we considered multiple tests for most of our outcomes, including symptom change, illness and mood.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, because we were still testing for several of the variables, we did not make a final decision for each outcome.	StatisticalAnalysis
One more limitation to the analysis approach is that we assessed no underlying interactions between the primary endpoints.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, our statistical analyses involved multiple variables; however, these are independent of other factors, which may have affected the results.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, the primary analysis did not take into account secondary outcomes, so there may be a potential for causality in the outcome models.	StatisticalAnalysis
Also, as multiple factors were assessed at each time point, we concluded that there was insufficient evidence of significant associations, and that therefore our main effect on outcome was causal.	StatisticalAnalysis
A negative sample size could have contributed to the low rate of success among our randomized trials, because we assessed different outcome measures in each sample.	StatisticalAnalysis
Last, our secondary analyses of outcome variables are limited by the possibility that we might have missed some of the more relevant outcomes in this study.	StatisticalAnalysis
This study was not designed to validate efficacy in a large scale.	StudyDesign
First, this was a pilot study.	StudyDesign
Furthermore, the study was an open-label study and there was no formal plan for the recruitment or follow-up phase of the intervention.	StudyDesign
While it is possible to collect data by means of a cluster randomization, the study design and analysis are complex, and the findings in this study are not automatically adjusted.	StudyDesign
Another important study limitation is that there was no randomized control group, and thus no randomized control of the study.	StudyDesign
The design is experimental, and we had no intention to restrict sample size.	StudyDesign
Participants did not have the flexibility to adopt or modify the study design, and therefore the study was not able to conclude an association between study design and causal effects.	StudyDesign
A smaller group ossification design reduces the ability for multicenter randomized trials to be fully replicated.	StudyDesign
The feasibility study design makes it more difficult to reach a formal conclusion regarding the importance of the cohort as a way to support a larger study.	StudyDesign
Lastly, the study was based on observational data, not a randomized control group.	StudyDesign
Our results indicate that we used a randomised design.	StudyDesign
Our study sample was primarily representative of a large group of patients with acute pain with a small number of patients in the secondary analyses.	StudyDesign
The cluster-randomized nature of our study suggests that there may be potential for some flexibility in designing this study.	StudyDesign
We evaluated a pragmatic approach, with the intention to learn from our data.	StudyDesign
We also emphasized the need to carefully design the study because we wanted to explore the possible implications of using a registry approach, especially in the context of the EIA.	StudyDesign
Furthermore, because the treatment duration of this intervention was longer than that of its parent studies, we did not evaluate long-term side effects of the drug with high frequency in the cohort versus the follow-up study.	StudyDuration
In addition, the first year after initiation of the study could be used to test for significant changes in clinical outcome following the introduction of lithium, which is a powerful antioxidant.	StudyDuration
We did not have a long-term follow-up period; this would not be a concern for most people interested in clinical research on the mechanisms of long-term remission.	StudyDuration
However, the early termination of treatment is the key issue in this study and hence our aim was to evaluate the effect of SSRI on SSRI-treated patients within 6 months.	StudyDuration
Second, there was a corresponding change in CPR over a shorter period of time (none of which was significantly reduced) but it would be beneficial to examine long-term effects of treatment on achieving improvement in patient compliance.	StudyDuration
However, in the following section the study was based on a 9-month time frame and this can be limited because it is only prospectively available.	StudyDuration
The study did not include an extended follow-up period, as it would have been useful for a longer-term evaluation of the efficacy of the DMRT in addition to evaluating mDRT for any adverse effects.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, the study was not long enough to determine whether the antidepressants had any impact on the initial symptoms, but only later on in the course of follow-up.	StudyDuration
A shorter follow-up period of 3 months is necessary to adequately examine long-term effects of neoadjuvant treatment in patients with ED.	StudyDuration
Third, we tested 6 months to assess the efficacy of lithium on bone loss.	StudyDuration
One concern with this prospective cohort study was the shorter duration of follow-up that was elicited by a number of adverse events.	StudyDuration
We could not extend the duration of this study to allow discussion of the effects of treatment on the long-term health status of patients with syphilis and lupus and on the risk of esophageal stenosis.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, the end of the 6-month duration of our study does not indicate an accurate assessment of the efficacy of treatment for clinical symptoms.	StudyDuration
However, it is unlikely that the two-year follow-up will provide long-term clinical effects, despite a complication with the maintenance of treatment costs.	StudyDuration
This may be further refined and extended by including further follow-up with follow-up of all reversible b.c.	StudyDuration
This is due to the elicitation of data from the clinicians, which might have been due to patient bias.	Blinding
The data were not blinded; however, a number of participants (e.g., those with significant preoperative depression) could have been blinded to the study.	Blinding
The endocrine changes could be due to bias in the utilisation of stents (or lack of).	Blinding
The blinding effect of randomisation would have been reduced in the event that the interventions were administered blinded.	Blinding
The use of a blinded intervention may have been partially mitigated by the use of an individual protocol, which would introduce a level of self-reporting error.	Blinding
Although no formal blinding was required, some of the participants may have been unblinded.	Blinding
The absence of blinding in the CPRA may explain why patient recruitment did not increase.	Blinding
Perhaps it was because of an assessment bias, which could be due to the presence of patients, that the results of the intervention might have been altered by the investigator after they had completed the intervention.	Blinding
The participants were not blinded to the assessment protocol, but could be blinded to the participants.	Blinding
Because our study design was blinded, the bias in treatment was also present and the bias may have been due to the inclusion of an inactive patient at baseline.	Blinding
The blinding effect was also reduced by the practice team not receiving blinded data.	Blinding
Given the nature of the study, the results of an individual patient's intervention could be unblinded but may not be used to inform a clinician's blinding decisions.	Blinding
An additional methodological barrier would be to create a “blind effect” if the participants were blinded to the intervention or to each other.	Blinding
However, it was not possible to measure the number of patients blinded to the primary intervention.	Blinding
Although the study was not blinded, participants could have misinterpreted the outcome variables.	Blinding
We assessed our active and passive clinical response by comparing both groups with the control, which was based on the hypothesis that we should consider the efficacy of the two placebo arms and also the impact of the addition of one active arm on disease progression and treatment.	Control
Furthermore, because neither treatment was controlled, the results of this study could not be assessed in a randomized controlled trial.	Control
By including a control group only, it is not possible to calculate the total benefit from the intervention – this is unlikely due to the small sample size, and the small sample sizes in this trial.	Control
In the absence of a control arm, the presence of only one treatment arm is not statistically meaningful, because no control arms have been selected in this study.	Control
Rather than being a controlled trial, the placebo arm in the study used a standardised protocol with an individualized, randomized trial protocol, thereby optimizing the impact of the study and providing the optimal treatment.	Control
Having another arm to compare was also beneficial in that it provided a better overall outcome compared to the placebo arm.	Control
By not incorporating a control group in this study, we could not establish how beneficial emssoremorrhagic gout reduction is with dietary changes, and could not determine whether an active control group would be able to achieve this benefit.	Control
As a control we have assumed that our patients would receive appropriate treatment, but instead received the intervention in a ‘concurrent’ fashion.	Control
This group was also not randomized, meaning no control group was selected to assess the effects of a controlled intervention on disease progression.	Control
In the absence of an active control group, the presence of active control would not be significant given the lack of a control group.	Control
In the absence of control in our study, the intervention was more akin to a placebo than to a therapeutic intervention.	Control
The control condition was not a control so it is unknown whether or not the effect of the placebo was significant (as the control was not administered during a treatment period).	Control
The placebo group in this trial was also not well designed to mimic our treatment methods, and therefore would be inappropriate in this study, because of the relative importance of the intervention.	Control
In the absence of a control group we did not have a control group.	Control
The absence of an active control in BGAD is largely attributable to the fact that it did not have a specific treatment.	Control
The large sample size of the AIM study makes this a difficult limitation.	MissingData
We lacked clinical information for participants with a disability and a history of disability, although more detailed information was available for some participants.	MissingData
However, in this study there were no re-entries of the behavioural and behaviour measurement variables for which participants were unable to be registered (e.g., cardiovascular mortality, insulin use, and gastrointestinal symptoms).	MissingData
However, in contrast to our study, we did not collect serum glucose level or other serum parameters on a daily basis, and we could not determine this variable.	MissingData
First, the relatively small number of participants in the first arms of the study could be explained by the low baseline response to the EDGAR study (P0.0001).	MissingData
However, we also missed a number of serum n-grams and urine albumin levels.	MissingData
Furthermore, only 94% of the total number of participants participated in the study, so that potential co-morbidity and/or mortality could have been predicted by the primary outcome measures.	MissingData
The study design was based on an assumption that all participants would join in for the duration of the study.	MissingData
In our second analysis, participants were excluded from the follow-up visit.	MissingData
In the latter part of the study, we were not able to obtain blood or biochemical information on blood clotting.	MissingData
We did not obtain blood glucose, oral fluid or urine concentrations in our study.	MissingData
We were not able to obtain a full report of the clinical data from study participants.	MissingData
This limitation has been attributed to the relatively low number of participants who completed both of the intervention groups, implying some limitations in our ability to collect complete data at the follow-up visit.	MissingData
Second, patients with diabetes took a proportional number of days for physical activity, with a maximum of 10% of patients reporting it.	MissingData
The use of prespecified comorbidities is challenging because of the low number of patients who were enrolled, who were not followed up or who were not admitted.	MissingData
Another limitation of our analysis is the non-covariate nature of the tests.	StatisticalAnalysis
Third, we did not use covariates because we treated them as independent of covariates.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, our multivariate analysis model was based on a number of independent variables, which raises the issue of potential parametric error.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, we conducted a number of other analyses that would result in a higher number of effects (as indicated by the lower number of analyses), such as influencing the initiation of titration for a vascular disease.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, despite our multiple comparisons, we did not test for psychological changes in young adulthood.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, we were unable to perform multiple analyses, and the risk for a causal relationship between the aforementioned factors is substantial.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, our statistical model was not designed to take into account multiple variables, such as cognitive test, emotional distress, and clinical assessment.	StatisticalAnalysis
Additionally, we adjusted for multiple outcome variables to account for a number of interactions and potential effect variables on BMD.	StatisticalAnalysis
Given our design, a number of other variables were evaluated for interaction, which could have introduced an underlying error in our analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we performed multiple tests, we could not separate out potential risk factors of stroke or heart attack, and the risk of stroke could be reduced by the loss of a neurochemical factor from the analysis, which may account for the observed association with stroke.	StatisticalAnalysis
One limitation of the model is that we did not use a test for differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, thereby introducing significant non-random factors into the model.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, we conducted multiple analyses of health care and work factors, and because of these statistical tests, we could not treat the significant individual factors of interest.	StatisticalAnalysis
A possible effect of age, race, and gender is that anxiety and depression can also cause anxiety in an adult.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, because we did not conduct a randomized trial of secondary outcomes, we discarded all other possible covariates in the analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we had multiple hypothesis tests, it is possible that our model included multiple independent variables, and therefore the results could be sensitive to multiple factors.	StatisticalAnalysis
Furthermore, the p-values associated with each of the groups were not significant, which may explain the small number of patients who had significant adverse events.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we assessed a number of independent factors, one of which could be linked to age, gender, race, and lifestyle, the risk of stroke or mental illness is greater.	StatisticalAnalysis
Also, although we did not test for a significant grouping of potential risk factors, it is possible that a small number of untested variables could have affected outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
This approach was based on one or more random effects, however.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, a few of the outcomes had significant effect on the survival of TB patients with BME.	StatisticalAnalysis
Another limitation is that we only analyzed two outcomes, which may have caused significant variability in the outcome score, namely weight gain and stroke.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, we also did a number of non-statistical analyses, including a t-test and a lagging test.	StatisticalAnalysis
Lastly, we did not control for any important independent variables.	StatisticalAnalysis
Our primary outcome was not statistically significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we adjusted for multiple independent variables, we were not able to include a significant effect on the number of traumatic events in the frightened or stressed patients.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, our primary outcome was primary prevention of cancer; nevertheless, the significance of our tests was low (p=0,01).	StatisticalAnalysis
Lastly, although our analysis was randomised, multiple factors were tested.	StatisticalAnalysis
Consequently, we had multiple statistical tests – one of which was not significant– and that would explain some of the differences between the groups.	StatisticalAnalysis
Also, our secondary analysis approach led to a significant increase in non-specific cAMPs in the participants.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, several factors are associated with dementia, which could be associated with cardiovascular disease and the development of obesity-related complications (Table 1).	StatisticalAnalysis
However, this approach does not provide a timeframe for evaluating the clinical significance of effects and the long-term stability of the intervention.	StudyDuration
Therefore, in our study, the primary end point was three years although we expected to achieve adequate effect by then.	StudyDuration
Moreover, the timeframe for assessing the effect of GABA may be shorter than a clinical study, but longer term follow-up may be needed to validate the long-term effect of GABA on risk of Alzheimer's disease (see Table 4).	StudyDuration
Possibly, however, the trial duration was short (a few months) and was associated with a greater dependence on long-term therapy.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of this study is that a longer period is required for assessing the effects of lithium therapy on the onset of weight loss and chronic fatigue.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, this study does not examine the effect of a follow-up test on the triglyceride concentration, as it would be expected to have on the levels of triglycerides in healthy patients with severe mental illness.	StudyDuration
Consequently, it was not possible to establish a long-term cure-all for depression in a clinical trial setting with no duration of observational follow-up and not to determine the effects of changes in mood on risk of depression on anxiety and depression.	StudyDuration
In addition, in most trials, the effect of dose and treatment duration is seen after two years, which is short, considering the effects on the underlying pathological factors and the clinical signs and symptoms.	StudyDuration
Second, we examined treatment-terms of 2 months duration, and only 5 of the 8-month durations of the treatment tended to meet the treatment-term criteria of 2 months.	StudyDuration
However, it is possible that the duration of the study (after one year) could be extended to provide a better understanding of the effects of early interventions.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, the duration of the study is very short and would not be adequate for evaluating the effects of drug therapy on chronic pain.	StudyDuration
A later evaluation period would be required to assess the effect of the anti-inflammatory medication for the vascular disease, but there are no permanent evidence that would support this conclusion.	StudyDuration
This study was initially designed for a shorter period of time, but it has been shown that this is not the best treatment strategy.	StudyDuration
A longer trial period would be needed to fully investigate the effect of DVT on a single target group of patients, in addition to having a longer follow-up interval.	StudyDuration
We also evaluated a shorter period of follow-up than was initially planned in a larger cohort of patients.	StudyDuration
Additionally, the sample size in the ACT and HC trials is not representative of the total number of patients who enrolled in the intervention (see Table 1).	MissingData
However, the study included no data on any of the follow-up studies.	MissingData
Additionally, we were unable to obtain complete outcome data for most of the randomized trials.	MissingData
First, we did not have adequate information on the impact of nutritional change on blood pressure.	MissingData
Although this study was limited in number and in quality, we found a significant proportion of participants not to be in both arm groups after the end of the first study visit.	MissingData
This is due to the difficulty in obtaining quantitative data on participant responses (e.g., time to completion of studies).	MissingData
This was more pronounced in the older groups and was particularly evident in the DMOS cohort with a high proportion of non-responders.	MissingData
First, we could not assess the rate of patient discontinuation between each week.	MissingData
This is due to the fact that the sample sizes varied from 5 to 24.	MissingData
We were not able to collect the patient demographic data for the study group.	MissingData
We were unable to contact participants after 3 months of randomization.	MissingData
Additionally, the absence of data on cardiovascular events is a major limitation of the study, and the clinical findings on opportunistic events appear to be limited.	MissingData
Furthermore, there were no information on all clinical outcomes of participants who discontinued the study.	MissingData
The absence of a physical examination or physical examination in the third or fourth visits to the hospital could account for some of this variation.	MissingData
Although we could obtain clinical data from some subjects, we did not have time for additional follow-ups.	MissingData
As a result, the results from this study may not necessarily be transferrable to other disease states.	Generalization
The findings described above are intended to be generalized to include patients with higher BP or higher blood pressure.	Generalization
The data derived from our results only applied to patients with known or suspected psoriatic arthritis in our patient cohort.	Generalization
Therefore, our findings are specific to the type of stroke in which the patient is ill.	Generalization
This study was not generalizable to patients with chronic pulmonary embolism (CBE), because its limitations in terms of the effectiveness of the T2Rs did not extend to all cBADs.	Generalization
Therefore, the results used may not be generalizable to other conditions, e.g., acute respiratory distress and obesity, since the study was confined to individuals enrolled in an acute care center.	Generalization
This may limit the ability to apply the findings to other populations.	Generalization
Hence, the results might not be generalizable to a larger group of subjects.	Generalization
First, despite the limited impact of the findings in our study on BMI, the authors were unable to interpret their findings in general.	Generalization
Therefore, as the results of the current study were limited to patients with a chronic illness, we do not assume that the results of this study can be generalized to patients with any chronic disease or other major chronic conditions.	Generalization
The current findings apply only to the patients who had been treated with the Xeroglutinin.	Generalization
We think the results from the VU-HIT study can be generalized.	Generalization
Therefore, the results of our study may not be universally replicated in other settings, particularly within the clinic.	Generalization
Secondly, this approach was applied to the main study population in the absence of data on the prevalence of disease in the general population.	Generalization
Second, because the outcome of our study was specific to children, we cannot guarantee that the results may be mirrored across other children with the same characteristics of CFS.	Generalization
Although there were sufficient biochemical profiles to determine the incidence of hepatitis, a small percentage of patients (5 %) did not participate.	MissingData
Second, although most of the subjects remained in the intervention, the loss to follow-up to follow-up was not unusual.	MissingData
A further limitation is that the phenotypes of all BAD patients in the EAST-P study were small.	MissingData
It is important to emphasize that the absence of laboratory and thoracic core temperature measurements in the study (Figure 7) resulted in a significant decrease in patient outcomes (Fig. 6).	MissingData
Given the high dropout rate, the possibility of an interventional error could not have been excluded, as there was no record of a study participant remaining in the study in the absence of an interventional error.	MissingData
Furthermore, only 38% of participants in the study were willing to complete the reserch.	MissingData
As a result of clinical and biochemical limitations, only 5% of trial participants attended all four treatment visits.	MissingData
Additionally, we could not assess the use of additional follow-up parameters for the BPCT or for the A-score.	MissingData
Although some patient response data were obtained from the intervention, data were not available for baseline body mass index (BMI) or body temperature.	MissingData
In addition to the serum cholesterol, no detailed information was obtained on vascular status during the physiotherapy session, and our analysis of BP indices was a bit less comprehensive, with a larger number of patients dropped after physiotherapy.	MissingData
Although it is possible that other factors might have influenced adherence in some of the patients who enrolled in the study, these may not be relevant for the general interpretation of clinical outcomes.	MissingData
Second, we had limited information on diet and sleep status in the HF ELISA group, a number of variables that may limit a study’s utility.	MissingData
Because of the nature of our intervention, we were not able to obtain clinically meaningful information on baseline medical history (e.g., heart rate, stroke, and blood pressure).	MissingData
Notably, we could not obtain a full picture of the physical condition of patients with diabetes under the influence of daily exercise.	MissingData
Although the proportions of study participants in each study were large, the quality of the response to treatment and the length of stay in the study were much lower than in the other interventions.	MissingData
We may not have performed a full-body randomized clinical study and therefore would be difficult to assess if participants were unblinded to the intervention.	Blinding
The data collection process itself is fairly blind.	Blinding
Because participants are unable to hide their participation in the interventions, an examination of the results is required.	Blinding
Given that the participant-centred approach (an intervention based on the nave observation protocol) would have been less reliable, the use of a nave approach to evaluation would be considered as bias.	Blinding
Were participants blinded to the intervention, the effects of intervention on patients would have been larger than if they had been injected directly, thereby reducing the confidence in obtaining and retaining information.	Blinding
A clinical assistant may have been blinded to the intervention (although we have no data on such blinding).	Blinding
Another possible mechanism of unblinding would be the use of a non-randomized control group with no follow-up for a given intervention.	Blinding
In addition, patients may have been blinded to which intervention they received.	Blinding
The intervention was not blinded, but there could have been an effect of patient blinding (the naive assumption that participants were not blinded by other people receiving an intervention.	Blinding
In addition, participants might have questioned whether they had received a second dose of nebulizer at the end of their treatment.	Blinding
The authors of the study used two identical approaches, so it would have been impossible to assess the effectiveness of either intervention without blinding.	Blinding
Given the small acoustic threshold for blinding, it would be difficult to determine how much exposure (intentional or intentional) the clinicians received during the study.	Blinding
Another possible limitation of blinding is that there may have been some variation in participants' treatment and behaviour among the various groups of acupuncturists who were blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
One possibility is that the participants were not blinded to the intervention, but that participants were blinded to the outcome variables (e.g., blood pressure and systolic cholesterol).	Blinding
However, it would have been difficult to predict patient blinding in an experimental study, as participants often reported their interventions as unblinded and the intervention was unblinded.	Blinding
Nevertheless, although the study group was not randomised, we found significant differences in comorbidity between patients in two groups.	Randomization
This observation is probably associated with the low rate of intra-operative nausea, but it is not likely to have been significantly associated with these observed changes.	Randomization
Although the analysis was similar to the previous study, the effect of an extra treatment on treatment outcomes was much larger in the latter study, which explains the difference in treatment outcomes.	Randomization
The difference was due to an unspecified confounding effect of treatment type (reference group) and to an expected effect size that is associated with the outcome variables.	Randomization
While we are still investigating the nature of the effects of this approach in this study, we do not expect to find significant significant differences in clinical outcomes.	Randomization
However, as there was no sample size limitation, the effect of randomization on outcome on the ocular disease is different from that of the outcome group, so this observation might explain the observed differences.	Randomization
While it was a significant confound, randomization has some limitations.	Randomization
However, because we used an international population randomisation scheme, our results are not comparable to our results with respect to the number of clinical variables in each treatment group.	Randomization
It is notable that two unaffected patients in each treatment group were randomly assigned to a particular phenotype, but only one was randomized.	Randomization
A secondary effect of the addition of a second intervention was introduced when a third patient with unresolved ulcer was randomized.	Randomization
Because the clinical trials were conducted simultaneously, there is an advantage in comparing patients from different sites, but this bias may have been due to the different levels of patients.	Randomization
In addition, although randomisation was more frequent, not all patients were randomly assigned to the two groups of eCGs (Table 2–3).	Randomization
Despite the relatively low proportion of participants in this study, the results from the randomization suggest that the study’s effects on the risk of morbidity were significantly different, but are not comparable to those observed in the population control group.	Randomization
Another limitation of this study was that no control group was randomly allocated between the two treatment groups, which could have been avoided in a few patients.	Randomization
Similarly, although randomization could not be performed, an important limitation of randomisation is that the randomized control was not followed up.	Randomization
The administration of a placebo might have been slightly less transparent.	Blinding
The potential bias of the pharmacovigilance in a patient-controlled study has been attributed to the presence of an instrument-blinding protocol; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that participants may have been blinded.	Blinding
The study was designed as an open-label, independent investigation whereas participants were not blinded, and so the method of receiving the results was not blinded.	Blinding
Second, we assumed that participants were unaware of who received which treatment.	Blinding
A method to assess intervention accuracy and optimisation of patient effects is also possible, but this method does not allow for a measure of individual participants' decision-making.	Blinding
In addition, participants may have felt unblinded when a participant entered the intervention and then left the intervention.	Blinding
It is likely that the study participants had been blinded to the outcome, if they were not also blinded to the outcome.	Blinding
The use of participants with mildly improved vascular function in early age was the primary motivation for participation in the XVI study and therefore bias was not experienced.	Blinding
In addition, the present study was administered unblinded, therefore a potential blinding bias occurred when a patient was not blinded to treatment intervention.	Blinding
Despite the standardization of the clinical management plan, a potential bias was introduced by patients in the primary care setting.	Blinding
During the follow-up period participants may not have been blinded to their intervention, and it may have been difficult to determine who had gotten the intervention, particularly in light of the significant amount of time spent at the centre.	Blinding
The data obtained from the intervention were not blinded, so we do not know the effect of participant blinding on the final outcome.	Blinding
Second, patients are probably not blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
First, there was no a priori knowledge of participants’ intentions.	Blinding
Some participants may have been unblinded, and so a bias between the 2 groups in the same intervention could potentially occur.	Blinding
The clinicians were not blinded, but one might assume that they had been blinded by a placebo.	Blinding
Because this was an independent study, it is possible that blinding would have introduced a large lag between the intervention results and the patient’s reported outcome.	Blinding
However, participants were not blinded to the treatment group or to the number of patients who received it.	Blinding
However, the assessment was not blinded, and some unblinded participants may have been unable to identify the intervention.	Blinding
Alternatively, participants might have been blinded to the interventions delivered through a private practice.	Blinding
In addition, an assessment may not have been blinded if participant blinding was absent.	Blinding
Given that participants were not blinded to the study design, the outcomes of a clinical study should not have been subject to any double-blinding, because this is a technique of observation that is difficult to carry out.	Blinding
First, it was not expected that the participant in the blinded study would alter the characteristics of their condition in a manner that would have prevented such a blinding.	Blinding
The inclusion of self-reports during the study might reduce the significance of an error in choice of treatment.	Blinding
A second bias occurred when the participants stopped using a specific treatment, but this could be avoided if the randomised interventions were re-ran after the randomisation is completed.	Blinding
The investigators in the CRC did not deliberately avoid participants with significant social or psychological disability, thus making this study unblinded.	Blinding
However, patients might have been influenced by the administration of the intervention by a professional therapist, who would have been responsible for selecting appropriate intervention strategies.	Blinding
This is possible, but it is unclear whether the clinical data were unblinded (e.g., with a placebo).	Blinding
We do not know whether participants were blinded to the intervention by their neurologist, but if they were, the results would likely be different compared to what would be expected if the interventions had been repeated.	Blinding
We were not blinded in the data collection, but the treatment team should have been blinded in the event of a change in the dose.	Blinding
However, our multivariate analyses might make it more difficult to draw conclusion about individual factors influencing stroke risk.	StatisticalAnalysis
We applied the underlying covariates method to all our analyses, which includes secondary outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
This may indicate the sensitivity of our analysis to single factors, but this may not have been the case for some of the factors tested.	StatisticalAnalysis
Fourth, although we grouped our outcomes by a different number of independent variables, we tended to conclude that the significant effect on mortality was independent of age and the presence of diabetes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, we did not adjust for multiple outcomes in our analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
One possibility that a high level of confidence could be associated with higher BMI is that we adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, and personality in the analysis of life events (Figure 1).	StatisticalAnalysis
Third, we did not conduct any multiple regression analysis; therefore, we must have performed some statistical analyses that could have revealed additional associations in addition to a single outcome.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because our analyses were non-random, it is possible that we missed some potential interactions, and that these potential interactions might have influenced outcomes of the randomized analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Despite a strong preclinical outcome, the hypothesis-driven approach demonstrates weaker significance and increased probabilities of missing the target by multiple measures.	StatisticalAnalysis
The multiple testing procedure, which we used in our analyses, could explain the lower number of events affecting BMD (Fig. 3).	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, our two multiple logistic regression models could account for all of the independent variables.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, we adjusted our threshold for multiple measures of life satisfaction (MQ) at the end of the trial.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, we did not adjust for multiple interactions.	StatisticalAnalysis
Although we controlled for a number of randomizations, the results could be confounded by several effects; for example, having a significant age in your first year in your second arm or stomach could result in lower BMI, which would be associated with a significant increase in BMI.	StatisticalAnalysis
As such, there is a small possibility that we underestimated the magnitude of effects on the risk of diabetes in individuals with diabetes, such as increased risk of stroke and an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease.	StatisticalAnalysis
Firstly, our follow-up of participants from the two arms was extremely limited, as a small proportion of patients in the study lost interest in the antenatal treatment at the end of the primary study (5%) and so the impact of the randomization on study outcome was limited.	MissingData
We had no biochemical measurements of patients with dehydration.	MissingData
First, there were very limited clinical follow-up data at each visit.	MissingData
Interestingly, most of the participants dropped out of the study due to lack of interest in the study.	MissingData
We did not have any complete information on age or gender during follow-up, and some patients did not have completed their questionnaires at the end of the study.	MissingData
Given the small sample size of the study, it is not possible to conclude how large the effect of withdrawal on cognitive performance is, with regard to the total time spent in study-based studies.	MissingData
However, this finding does not reflect any significant variation in the incidence of gastrointestinal illness in the intervention group or in the cohort.	MissingData
Unfortunately, this study was not followed up to the completion of the second cycle, which is problematic because it did not have time for follow-up of enrolments (e.g.	MissingData
It is unclear why so many of the participants discontinued the study, possibly because of a lack of interest in being randomly allocated to a more appropriate treatment.	MissingData
We had no patient with diabetes in the EXILIS cohort.	MissingData
Although we found no difference in patients' adherence to saline treatments, it is possible that participants' attitudes towards saline therapy may have contributed to their high adherence to saline treatments.	MissingData
We do not have a summary of any of the participants’ health statuses, although we noted some underlying information that may contribute to our overall understanding of the effects of the intervention.	MissingData
Notably, the study was not updated annually, and it was not possible to follow up on data.	MissingData
Second, the number of patients missing from the study was relatively small (>3 months), which may be attributed to the lower number of participants who had completed the study.	MissingData
In addition, it may have been problematic to obtain laboratory data on patients with chronic pulmonary disease after completing the AFTA protocol.	MissingData
Moreover, this was a short-term trial, with a recurrence rate of about 25-30%.	StudyDuration
However, it was not clear how long this phase of therapy could last compared to more conventional evaluations.	StudyDuration
However, the time-to-treatment period of these treatment trials was not sufficiently long for us to evaluate the effect of the study on the acute disease outcome, and further trials with a longer treatment duration were needed to confirm the hypothesis of long-term efficacy.	StudyDuration
The study duration was also long; this is probably due to the increased risk of tremor.	StudyDuration
We are aware of a 5-year follow-up for clinical trials in diabetes whose onset was shorter than 8 months, but the longer period might explain the shorter duration of the clinical trials.	StudyDuration
Another disadvantage of the study was that it only lasted 6 months, but that would have slowed the rate of change in severe anemia if treatment duration were extended to a longer period of time.	StudyDuration
However, the most durable follow-up period does not allow us to explore the impact of our treatment on the underlying neurologic conditions that cause changes in the brain over the long-term, such as dementia.	StudyDuration
Lastly, the duration of follow-up period was not long enough to identify a permanent effect on the treatment outcome.	StudyDuration
However, long-term follow-up may have limited effect on treatment outcome, and it is possible that follow-up may be extended after one year (i.e., 6 months).	StudyDuration
Second, it is difficult to assess the full-result effects of lithium on the primary CNS of osteoarthritis in a 24-week trial.	StudyDuration
One limitation is the time-to-result time-to-adventure of the effects of THA in this population.	StudyDuration
Although a follow-up period is required for long-term improvement of the treatment effects, the results are less clear at shorter time points.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, the study did not include a follow-up period, so it was not possible to determine the long-term effects of lithium on CHD.	StudyDuration
Second, the 6-8-year duration of the study does not allow for a comparison between long-term effects and shorter time-courses.	StudyDuration
Second, the duration of follow-up period is too short to allow a definitive assessment of the impact of calcium supplements.	StudyDuration
The multicenter approach allows for the resulting reduction in patient harm in comparison to that associated with other trials.	Setting
Secondly, this trial was single-agent in nature, so that it could not compare the effect of our intervention on the outcome of DMZ treatment to the average of all studies conducted in this trial.	Setting
We were also able to use a single center system, and thus were able to reduce the amount of trial time involved.	Setting
Finally, setting of this trial involved one of the largest number of single centers in the country and so the quality of the trial as a whole is unknown.	Setting
Finally, our data did not include any single center analysis.	Setting
Our trial was small and single centre.	Setting
However, the low number of studies addressing this issue may limit our ability to consider the influence of a single centre on a single individual.	Setting
In the absence of a single center trial, a monocentric trial approach may be more suited for patients with anaemia with a larger pulmonary embolism.	Setting
Finally, it is of concern that our prospective studies were not published in a single center setting.	Setting
The use of an EDC to determine treatment efficacy reflects the smaller number of trials that were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nitric oxide on blood pressure in women with heart problems at a high risk of complications.	Setting
Moreover, our study involved an active research trial at a single center with a single-agent intervention in a single patient.	Setting
Especially in light of the small size of the study, a single centre setting with a single endpoint has been recommended.	Setting
The very low incidence of unintended events is a limitation of single center trials and it has been compared with three larger trials.	Setting
The toxicity of nitrates is similar to that of chloroform, which is commonly found in oral antibiotics but which is more sensitive and difficult to treat.	Setting
Furthermore, this approach requires substantial single site trials in order to achieve the best possible outcomes.	Setting
It is possible that the duration of treatment may be too short in the long-term to evaluate full efficacy; however, it would be appropriate to assess the effect on the level of improvement during the second year.	StudyDuration
The study was designed so that we could observe longer term benefits from DMT than may be anticipated in the long-term population studies.	StudyDuration
However, although we were not able to conclude long-term results, it appears that the effects of the initial narcotics will have a greater impact on long-term survival than placebo in the broader study population.	StudyDuration
Secondly, short-term time frames are needed to provide valid results, to understand long-term benefits of antiretroviral treatment.	StudyDuration
Second, the short duration of this clinical trial could have implications for further studies on the clinical effects of hormone therapy on edotocin receptor activity.	StudyDuration
The first two years of the study were not long enough to explore the effect of lithium on euphoria levels and on the recurrence rate.	StudyDuration
However, given the short duration of the treatment (e.g., 3 months), it would be appropriate to allow time for full clinical evaluation to determine whether any changes in symptom severity or severity occur.	StudyDuration
The relatively short follow-up period could help clarify the efficacy of the treatment for long-term acute anaemia, especially if treatment was discontinued in the later part of the trial.	StudyDuration
The 6 month duration of our study did not allow us to evaluate the efficacy of the study drug and may have contributed to the broader effect of treatment, especially on the change in BMI.	StudyDuration
A 2-4 year follow-up is required for the assessment of any effects on the Cmax value over time and longer durations are needed for future studies.	StudyDuration
This is one limitation of our study, in that the primary objective was to establish the duration of benefits from an effective maintenance intervention.	StudyDuration
Besides, a longer duration of follow up is needed to explore the hypotheses of what happens in the long-term in a chronic and chronic disease state.	StudyDuration
We investigated the impact of lithium on acute bone lesions but did not include an endpoint in the analysis.	StudyDuration
A longer period is necessary because the effect of prophylaxis might be transient and it is difficult to establish a longitudinal follow-up point.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, long-term follow-up would be required to explore the long-term effects of oral iron supplementation in adults with advanced disease.	StudyDuration
If a similar control was used then all the benefits of a single agent (control) would be lost in comparison to a single agent of the same size assuming a stable condition.	Control
As we did not have a control arm in this trial we chose to have either an active or a passive arm to avoid a potential overload.	Control
In addition, no control was added to our original design.	Control
Furthermore, both arm of this trial, and the subsequent arms of both arms, have been randomized to avoid having two different interventions (one with more of each compound at baseline and one with less compound at 5 years post-treatment).	Control
Thus, the control group in this study did not have the same level of intervention in the same amount of time.	Control
By combining the control and active groups of both arms, the two arm groups reflected more of an active group of participants and a more active control of our study.	Control
Therefore, the control arm was not used in this trial because the dose received had higher doses of occlusion prevention and because it was given as a standard of care and for educational reasons.	Control
Furthermore, our control arm did not have either a placebo arm or a placebo arm resulting from a lack of evidence for the efficacy of the placebo arm, suggesting that the trial was not suitable to evaluate the effect of an active placebo arm.	Control
The absence of a treatment control indicates that there was no difference in the clinical outcomes in our two study arms.	Control
Thus, a lack of placebo in our study might account for the difference in mean serum cholesterol levels in the dmt group.	Control
With the exception of a placebo group in which no control arm was used, it is difficult to conclude that there would be substantial differences in treatment effects between the two groups.	Control
The lack of a standard control in the CURE trial is perhaps due to the lack of an active control.	Control
Our control lacked the asymmetry of our treatment.	Control
Since the two arms of the trial were randomized, neither arm of this trial was deemed appropriate to assess how healthy participants were and could be in the setting of the study.	Control
The randomized trial which contained only control arm participants may have not produced any significant benefit in achieving the same clinical outcome as a normal control arm.	Control
Another limitation of our trial is the lack of follow-up at follow-up.	MissingData
Although there were several studies involving a higher proportion of patients without symptomatic changes, only the complete study had the total number of patients, which suggests a bias that may be due to the small number of participants who chose to participate in these trials.	MissingData
We had no data on the e-mail addresses of subjects who stopped the study, if they started the intervention, or the severity of illness in the first day of their visit.	MissingData
As the two patients left at 6 months, we were unable to assess the effects of the drug and other factors that influenced dietary intake.	MissingData
Furthermore, patients who did not complete their assessments of severity of dementia are very likely to have lost their mental capacity.	MissingData
Additionally, although more people participated in the study than in the original study, patients from the third trial had greater control and greater control over the duration of study (relative to baseline duration).	MissingData
Unfortunately, we did not have time to call participants after the course of their treatment, which is particularly problematic.	MissingData
Finally, as most of the participants were out of the study by 3 months, we could not identify a meaningful mean age at which the participants were withdrawn from the study.	MissingData
The lack of follow-up information in the clinical trials and the high adherence rate to all four treatment arms resulted in an imbalance in the study load, which may be due to lack of information on dose, regimen and follow-up.	MissingData
Our missing data were limited to the dose level and time spent in the study.	MissingData
One limitation of the study design was the high rate of exclusion.	MissingData
The trial was discontinued after a period of one year and we were unable to identify a cause of loss of weight from diet.	MissingData
A limitation of our study was our limited ability to collect clinical data (mean age, gender and socioeconomic status) at randomization and during follow-up.	MissingData
As part of our analyses of patients who did not complete all the assessment tasks, we could not obtain a baseline of patient age, physical activity, and physical activity.	MissingData
Finally, only 24% of the participants did not complete the questionnaires.	MissingData
One limitation of the study is that, although some enrolment data were collected, this was not a large proportion of the cohort, mainly due to the large number of participants not being eligible for follow-up.	MissingData
In addition, data related to the outcome of a patient who did not complete the follow-up assessment were not available for the other arms of the study, which may have had potential influence on the treatment of disease.	MissingData
Third, although we had a very large number of missing patients, the number of missing patients compared to healthy participants was high.	MissingData
In this study, we had no contact with patients who were not in the control arm.	MissingData
In addition to the toxicity data, patients from other groups (but not the intervention group) were not included in our analysis of a number of standardized variables.	MissingData
This limitation may have been caused by the limitation in information about acclimatization in study participants, such as the number and prevalence of ear infections and the presence or absence of blood glucose measurement and/or a CBC-like ratio of acclimatisation after acclimatization.	MissingData
Although there is a positive trend in number of complete trials, this may not be due to a lack of sufficient numbers of patients unable to complete the study.	MissingData
An important limitation of this study was the small number of patients who dropped out of the study.	MissingData
Furthermore, the nature of the study is quite unclear and there is a potential absence of a clear baseline distribution of cutaneous Tb, with a possibility for subgroup dispersion based on clinical outcome.	MissingData
The high proportion of nave subjects who did not complete the study, with a further proportion dropping to 30%.	MissingData
In the absence of follow-up data, the prospective nature of the ELTA intervention implies that the majority of patients did not visit the study center at least twice a week.	MissingData
We hoped that the lack of questionnaires could be overcome, but we do not know the number of participants who responded.	MissingData
Second, the lack of objective measurement in the BPs was partly due to a lack of information on BPs (which could have reduced BPs, compared with BPs).	MissingData
Because we could not track the number of randomized patients, it might be hard to draw general conclusions about the reasons for such large numbers.	MissingData
A limitation of our studies was that we did not have data for a large number of patients with chronic renal failure who were treated in the ACG.	MissingData
Third, the findings in our study were only generalizable to patients with acute low back pain.	Generalization
Furthermore, as this study is limited in generality, the results may not be transferrable to patients with MDR2 [21, 21].	Generalization
Therefore, our findings may not be universally generalizable to individuals with more severe diabetes or chronic cardiovascular disease.	Generalization
Therefore, the current results are limited in their generalization to other conditions.	Generalization
However, in this context, it is important to consider the specific nature of our findings in order to make this study generalizable to other populations.	Generalization
Our results cannot be generalized to a larger population.	Generalization
As such, the results may not be applicable to all patients with the tummy ache or to patients with the tummy ache.	Generalization
The results of this study could not be generalized to the larger pool of patients with non-septic wounds who may develop the same symptoms as those with septic ulcers.	Generalization
Our findings may not be generalizable beyond our original settings, so we cannot expect the same results to be observed in other studies.	Generalization
Therefore, the results from our study are generalizable only to patients residing in other regions.	Generalization
This limits the generalization of the results to the general population and may limit the implication for future research on this asymptomatic condition.	Generalization
The use of the study results may not be generalized to all patients.	Generalization
Therefore, generalization may not be generalized to other participants with similar cognitive impairment (e.g.	Generalization
The results obtained from the present study may not be generalizable to other studies such as pulmonary hypertension.	Generalization
However, as with the current results, our results might not be generalizable beyond our clinic setting.	Generalization
This limitation limits the generalisability of the results to patients with congenital heart disease.	Generalization
The outcome of the study may not be replicated in other settings because the results from one study may have an effect on another, but it may still not be generalizable.	Generalization
This study may not be generalizable to other settings, because the results may not be transferrable to all clinical settings.	Generalization
Thus, the results of the current study may not be generalizable to other studies conducted on a similar subject.	Generalization
This results may not apply to the population compared with the outcome studied by other investigators.	Generalization
Therefore, the findings presented in this study may not necessarily be generalizable to other populations.	Generalization
First, the results described here can only be generalized to patients with the same disease.	Generalization
Consequently, the results we present here may not be generalizable to all patients and can only be used with the patient we were working with.	Generalization
This limitation of generalizability of our findings to a different treatment group may limit the application of our findings to individuals with chronic diseases.	Generalization
This limitation may limit the generalization of the findings because they are not transferable to other settings.	Generalization
In addition, the results of this study are valid only for the sexes randomized to the aforementioned program.	Generalization
Our data were obtained from the participants with high arterial stiffness (i.e., they had been treated with the current i.v.	Generalization
Finally, our results may not be generalizable to patients with similar chronic diseases.	Generalization
This approach makes generalization difficult, as the study was specific to the study of BID.	Generalization
This limitation limits the generalizability of the results given in the study to other populations.	Generalization
Perhaps more importantly, we did not observe a long-term follow-up time period for the clinical evaluation of tin sulphate into tin sulphate.	StudyDuration
Additionally, the term “trial period” is too short to address the main factors of the early onset of scleroderma and the effects of anti-inflammatory medications on the symptoms.	StudyDuration
Another limitation is that the study had a relatively short period of follow-up, which could be interpreted as a sign of an improvement in clinical symptoms, but with no way to monitor the changes over the course of the disease.	StudyDuration
Finally, we did not study the effect of placebo on HDL levels.	StudyDuration
This was due to the short duration of treatment and the short-term nature of the study.	StudyDuration
Second, the timescale of the study is rather short, with only two months for all treatments, so we did not test for sustained improvement in treatment quality in any of the 4 acupuncture treatments (as well as in other treatments).	StudyDuration
Moreover, the study also examined the effect of exercise on weight gain.	StudyDuration
Second, while 6-month duration would be ideal, the endpoint of 6-month is often shorter than 24-month duration.	StudyDuration
Moreover, long-term follow-up was required to evaluate the impact of the effects of the TCP treatment.	StudyDuration
The study had no duration of follow-up (>14 months) and no secondary endpoint was established.	StudyDuration
However, our results from later years are not conclusive; rather, it would be necessary to follow a longer period of time for further evaluation of the effects of therapy on reducing symptoms in scurvy patients.	StudyDuration
The shorter duration of our study could be due to the high level of treatment dependence upon weight gain and obesity.	StudyDuration
A study with 6 month follow up is needed to understand the impact of chronic pain on the long-term survival.	StudyDuration
Lastly, long-term follow-up is required to confirm the operative effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on postprandial glucose and could further explain the relatively small effect on non-stress hormones in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OSRD).	StudyDuration
Third, it would be interesting to study the long term effects of treatment on weight loss in children with obesity or on weight gain.	StudyDuration
First, the time-to-responder ratios were higher in ED (or a high ratio, due to the nature of the intervention) than in the control group, and the effect of treatment on survival was significant.	MissingData
Our main limitation was that we did not complete a comprehensive analysis of all imputations.	MissingData
Firstly, we did not have full details of daily meal intake.	MissingData
This study was subsequently discontinued by all of the surveyed patients.	MissingData
Second, we did not collect patient ages, but rather measured the age at which these patients began their intervention.	MissingData
Finally, despite the inclusion of a time series assessment to determine if it was possible to collect blood samples, it was not possible to calculate the duration of the clinical trials.	MissingData
However, the lack of detailed information on all comorbidities would have been inconvenient.	MissingData
Second, only 3 of the 5 patients missing from our study did not have medical records.	MissingData
Second, in most cases, participants were not available for a subgroup of the selected intervention, suggesting that non-research motivation may have contributed to the lower participation rates in the group.	MissingData
In addition, in this study, only the first two treatment groups were monitored to assess their response to the therapy.	MissingData
The large number of patients (10%) excluded from the study may have been influenced by their social environment (and thus affect the recruitment decisions).	MissingData
As noted earlier, our trial did not include patient demographic data, so it is likely that we will be unable to detect information on the clinical course of disease.	MissingData
The lack of follow-up after completion of the study might explain some of the observed dropout rates and the difficulties of obtaining routine clinical outcomes.	MissingData
Despite being discontinued in the study, participants who were excluded from the trial were still in the trial and they are not expected to be disenfranchised from participation in the next study.	MissingData
Our study has an almost complete absence of a single digit measurement in the first two weeks after the completion of each study (a small number of missing data), which is consistent with the observational nature of our study.	MissingData
Although this cohort included a few patients whose BP had increased significantly between 0.012 and 0.020 (a large variation compared to the unmatched groups), a large proportion of patients were out of the ICBM.	MissingData
We did not obtain physical examinations at baseline because of a relatively short duration of follow-up.	MissingData
Similarly, because of a lack of adequate follow-up, no data were obtained for blood glucose levels, and blood pressure levels were not assessed at enrolment.	MissingData
Finally, as we were limited in the number of participants with at least 3 clinical years between doses, we have been unable to obtain a baseline profile of patients who were discharged from the clinic.	MissingData
Finally, a large proportion of trial participants remained outside of the study.	MissingData
At the end of the study, patients left the study withdrawn for additional study unless they felt strongly discouraged by the lack of follow-up and/or were unable to complete a completed questionnaire.	MissingData
Another limitation of our study is the absence of quantitative measurements in the blood pressure and body temperature.	MissingData
Our trial had very low e-mail contact, and we were not able to contact people who received treatment at the end of the study.	MissingData
In addition to missing data for all outcomes, the a priori reasons for these difficulties could have included lack of time to complete the pharm-compliance registry (i.e. the number of hours of psychometric and/or psychiatric data with regard to clinical care induced by pharmacological therapy).	MissingData
We had no direct information regarding mortality in the tsc cohort.	MissingData
Another limitation of this study is that only 20% of the patients who completed the study reported having completed the study at the end of the treatment period.	MissingData
Unfortunately, there is no way to be sure how many patients completed the study.	MissingData
In addition, there was no follow-up analysis for some of our patients; this was because we conducted randomised trials, involving a few participants, in which some patients were still receiving treatment in an acute setting, and did not collect contact information.	MissingData
To explore how our patients affected by adolescent anxiety had access to data, it was necessary to obtain a broader picture of how their anxiety was related to lifestyle choices and behavioural decisions in a daily setting.	MissingData
We received incomplete data in assessing neonatal mortality at onset of presentation in each arm of the study; this is in part due to a high proportion of non-admitted patients, which may be associated with lower outcomes.	MissingData
Furthermore, in this study only 54% of participants participated in the prospective analysis.	MissingData
Finally, in our study we did not collect blood sample for all participants.	MissingData
Moreover, our prospective cohort study was incomplete with some participants only being able to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.	MissingData
We could not retrieve data for nbp, blood pressure and BMI (mean age +25 years).	MissingData
It is difficult to assess a causal relationship between dietary intake, daily physical activity and skeletal muscle volume after administration of oral medication.	MissingData
Initially, there was an absence of additional information regarding dietary intake.	MissingData
However, as the study took place during the study week, it was difficult to identify causal factors.	MissingData
Firstly, our results do not provide a summary of all adverse events with which we were unable to contact.	MissingData
However, the underlying explanation for this is that a proportion of the patients who did not complete the intervention in the first year was not available.	MissingData
We identified a high proportion of participants who did not complete their physical examination.	MissingData
Because it was not a part of our primary study design, it would have been particularly challenging to obtain the ophthalmic information needed to be able to evaluate the clinical effects of our intervention.	MissingData
An additional limitation of our study was that there was no systematic assessment of dietary intake.	MissingData
In addition, there were few follow-ups for patients subsequently removed from the study.	MissingData
First, only two participants were in the clinical trial at any one time.	MissingData
Furthermore, in assessing the impact of diet on body weight, dietary intake and sleep patterns were not always possible and there is a significant dropout rate in patients weighing over 50 kg.	MissingData
The researchers may not have wished to blind participants to study design or interventions.	Blinding
The study was not blinded because the assessment was administered in a single session (the subject may have been blinded to the intervention protocol).	Blinding
Despite the lack of blinding, participants remained open minded and their perceptions of treatment differences remained as they entered the intervention.	Blinding
First, participants were not blinded in their decision making process and, second, the design of the intervention was based on self-assessment, thus providing an indirect means of blinding.	Blinding
Second, the researchers did not perform double blind assessments before the first and second months of the study.	Blinding
In this case, patient blinding could have prevented bias, because participants may have been blinded by the intervention, but the blinding of the participants may not have been complete, because the intervention protocols were quite different.	Blinding
A significant study group should not have been blinded to participants, especially when the clinicians were not present to administer the intervention.	Blinding
A patient-blinding study with two subjects might have been more robust if a self-directed, self-controlled intervention was delivered, and if there was a deliberate change in practice at baseline (for example, by applying a supplementary regimen or switching to a randomized control group).	Blinding
Perhaps more significant than participants’ blinding was the observation of a participant with a labile cognitive ability, or a disability.	Blinding
In the presence of blinding, participants are unlikely to be blinded to the interventions that they receive.	Blinding
A patient who received both interventions may have considered that it had not been blinded by the interventionist, assuming the blinding of the interventionist to the treatment.	Blinding
Secondly, there was a high level of pre-observational variation, especially between participants.	Blinding
The study team also gave an indication that they were blinding participants to receiving either the MCI or an unsolicited placebo.	Blinding
The study team may have been unblinded if some people had regressed to self-medication at the end of the study, which may have contributed to the bias in the final analysis.	Blinding
However, the investigators' choice of intervention (sacrifice day or week) could affect patient blinding, and this effect is particularly acute in patients who receive a non-blinded, structured intervention.	Blinding
Second, while the MHRA's findings have been generalized to other patients in the study, they cannot be generalized to be applicable to all patients.	Generalization
Furthermore, our results are generalizable only to patients with GCR10 and those with EKG-crine abnormalities, who had not received the cGMD at the time of the trial.	Generalization
We therefore caution that the findings we report may not be applicable to the general population due to a potential limitation of the generalized design of the ELV.	Generalization
Our results are limited in their ability to be generalized to other settings, so it is important to consider other settings with a different level of epidemiological variation.	Generalization
The study was not designed to generalize the results.	Generalization
Because of the limitations of the above data, the results may not be generalizable to other clinical populations.	Generalization
The results of our study may not be generalizable to the case of all patients with biceps syndrome.	Generalization
Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to other cohorts, as the results described in our study are specific to this specific population.	Generalization
This limits our ability to generalize the findings to all patients.	Generalization
The results may not be generalizable to all patients and may not be generalizable to other patients with comparable disease patterns.	Generalization
Therefore, it is necessary for other prospectively controlled studies to replicate our findings in order to provide additional information on the effects of the Avmax in people with diabetes.	Generalization
A study that focused on a single study could not replicate the findings of this study in other studies, because the data are specific to patients with acute heart failure.	Generalization
It would therefore be challenging to extend this results to patients with an ill-defined illness.	Generalization
However, the results might not be generalizable to the larger cohort of people with more severe diabetes, or to persons with non-heart diseases.	Generalization
This limitation of the outcome study can result in limitations in the generalization of our results.	Generalization
Another limitation of the study is the completeness of data from the patients enrolled in the two additional intervention groups.	MissingData
It is difficult to conclude that at least 50 percent of participants were not enrolled on follow-up appointments.	MissingData
Our pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes were not available for participants with renal and/or renal impairment in both arms.	MissingData
We do not have complete and complete demographics or patient assessment data.	MissingData
In addition, the results are not comparable to the clinical data.	MissingData
We did not have clinical data for patients with diabetes, pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus.	MissingData
At the end of the TEM trial, we could not assess the effect of acupuncture on body temperature or body fluid balance, which are key variables for determining the dose of acupuncture.	MissingData
A limitation of the study was that a total of 87 patients died during the ACT-IV arm.	MissingData
However, we are limited by our clinical and biochemical evaluation results and therefore we could not obtain clinical data at study end.	MissingData
Further, the study was discontinuated after the second half of the study, because of limited motivational motivation and absence of motivation.	MissingData
Unfortunately, we did not obtain follow-up blood counts, but we were unable to obtain clinical outcomes from the patients with the most significant clinical disability, and so we were unable to evaluate the impact of interventions on lifestyle or social behaviors.	MissingData
The large number of participants was in a group of 8 with greater than 10% of participants not completing the MRI scan.	MissingData
However, due to the nature of the intervention, participants were not contacted for blood glucose measurements or serum samples.	MissingData
However, there was some variation in baseline characteristics between the two trials, suggesting some variation in the way patients were recruited.	MissingData
Although a small proportion of participants were unable to be reached by the end of the study, significant clinical variation may have influenced patient-reported adverse events.	MissingData
In the event of a false negative bias, the outcomes would be not fully recalled, as the participant may have been blinded to the administration of a second medication.	Blinding
The inclusion of an anonymous study design was also necessary to make the participants' performance-related observable.	Blinding
The potential for intervention bias from a non-blinded observer in a self-administered behavioural assessment would have been present if the intervention had been completed blinded to patients.	Blinding
However, the blinding biases may be higher if the participants are self-blinding, or if they were given two treatments together, i.e., the treatment was administered after a two-day session, or if the intervention was given in an unblinded way.	Blinding
An additional challenge is that the presence of an unblinded control group at the end of each of the trials may have created a perception of unblinding, particularly when participants were blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
However, although it would be impossible to detect the participants' treatment preferences during the blinded study, this may have resulted in unnaturally high treatment success rates for the patients in both studies.	Blinding
The use of non-blinding protocols also raises some questions about whether the investigators were blinded to participants' preferences, thereby allowing for the possibility of an unblinded evaluation.	Blinding
Furthermore, some participants were unable to understand the nature of the assessments because of their large size and the difficulty in determining their baseline cognitive ability.	Blinding
Another source of bias may be the use of blindedness by a study participant or by an observer who volunteered.	Blinding
However, in the absence of a double blind, it is difficult to define how treatment adherence (due to treatment regimen) and intervention outcomes were influenced by the use of the dilated VLB.	Blinding
A potential skew error may also have occurred in the syringes, which can be a limitation when assessing whether patients are blinded to the intervention or not.	Blinding
The first aspect of the prospective study was whether a researcher had an intention to collect data on the intervention or not.	Blinding
Moreover, if participants did not see their assessment, they would be subjected to a “double blind” observation.	Blinding
A similar approach could have been taken with an interventionist blinded to the interventionists' behaviour, causing the result to differ across patients (e.g., not inhalation, dose doubling, or sedation).	Blinding
We subsequently reported that the clinicians did not report whether participants were blinded to their treatment and that the participants were not unblinded to the intervention in either session.	Blinding
A randomized trial is an ideal opportunity for validation to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention interventions.	StudyDesign
In addition, our analysis relies on a randomised controlled trial design.	StudyDesign
The findings are challenging to interpret.	StudyDesign
The randomization protocol itself is flexible and does not permit site-specific analyses.	StudyDesign
The exploratory nature of the study requires the use of some design issues, including the decision not to include a site closure criteria.	StudyDesign
First, the study design is fairly simple.	StudyDesign
Additionally, the design flexibility of the cluster randomized design makes it difficult to establish a clear-cut measurable endpoint, such as study endpoints with large proportions of patients enrolled, or to define the intervention period.	StudyDesign
In addition, this study was a trial of a very small number of studies and thus it may not have been feasible to develop a single entry registry.	StudyDesign
In order to achieve this outcome, study participants were invited to participate in observational studies and to provide demographic information, but their participation did not result in the production of any statistical data.	StudyDesign
Although the study was open-ended and open-ended, the outcome measures were not analyzed for site-specific differences and did not allow for the use of any stratification controls (data manipulation, obfuscation, or stratification by octet size).	StudyDesign
Third, this study was not designed to test any other potential efficacy measurements, such as serum glucose, or serum transfusion.	StudyDesign
The need for trial replication allows for flexibility in the study design.	StudyDesign
The cluster randomization allows for a low number of stratified randomizations which may complicate decision making as we were not able to design the study to evaluate potential benefits of multiple groups.	StudyDesign
Randomization results may not be meaningful and we could not support a simple pilot design.	StudyDesign
Randomized controlled trials are an imperfect tool for assessing patient outcomes.	StudyDesign
However, it is important to consider that our findings only apply to the condition under evaluation.	Generalization
Our findings may not be generalizable to other patients or other settings.	Generalization
We consider it important that the results described here are not generalizable to the population of persons who were not exposed to the viral infection.	Generalization
The use of our results in another setting is important because it is related to an intervention to treat inflammation.	Generalization
Our findings are specific to the study under study.	Generalization
In particular, the findings of our study were conducted within the clinical setting of the trial and may not be generalizable to all patients or in all conditions.	Generalization
We thus caution that the results presented here should not be generalized to other patient groups in order to make a difference.	Generalization
Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to other patients.	Generalization
Furthermore, because the results were made at a high dose, we have limited capacity to generalize the results to all other patients and conditions with similar outcome.	Generalization
Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to other participants, as the results of the study are based on our findings.	Generalization
First, given the results in this study, it is important to ensure that the results are not generalizable to the larger cohort of patients in the current study.	Generalization
As such, the results described here are specific to that study; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to other patient groups.	Generalization
Hence, it is important to discuss the results from this study with other health care professionals so that they can understand the full consequences of the findings and apply the findings to other groups of patients, in order to improve the likelihood of a potential adverse outcome.	Generalization
A general interpretation of this conclusion may have implications for other study populations with similar outcomes in traumatic brain injury.	Generalization
Furthermore, our results may not be generalizable to patients with non-rheumatic diseases or chronic disease.	Generalization
In addition, a patient-blinding effect was possible if the participants subsequently changed their mind after the primary study was over, but the effect was still not known.	Blinding
The intervention was not blinded in that the subjects were blinded to the intervention intervention for the duration of the study.	Blinding
Consequently, it was important to consider the possibility that some of the outcomes were not blinded.	Blinding
Thus, the blinding effect may have been more pronounced in patients with the most frequent intervention in the intervention group (Figure 2.12).	Blinding
The patient may have received an anonymous, self-controlled study, and this would have increased the likelihood of an error or omissions.	Blinding
It is possible that participants were not blinded to the assessment design, but not to treatment outcome.	Blinding
Second, the physiotherapy was not blinded to any other intervention (e.g., a double-blind, randomized intervention).	Blinding
In addition, some participants could have been blinded to the intervention, which is the theoretical assumption.	Blinding
The primary outcome is the number of patients enrolled in the study.	Blinding
In addition, clinicians could have unblinded the data by excluding participants from the intervention.	Blinding
Given that our data were collected using a standardized telephone protocol, patients may have expected us to be more or less unblinded if we had asked them to fill out the questionnaires, thereby reducing the likelihood of participant ‘unblindness’.	Blinding
It was possible that the intervention design and delivery of the drug had not been blinded to participants' preferences but, since most of the participants were not blinded, it is possible that some observers or clinicians may have been aware of the outcome.	Blinding
In addition, the patient blinding of participants during the acupuncture training may have reduced the number of participants receiving the acupuncture sessions.	Blinding
First, we would have needed to obtain the intervention of the clinical supervisors in the study to ensure a meaningful perception of the intervention outcomes, given that the participant was blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
Although not necessary, the presence of placebo in the treatment room may have been due to participant blinding, which could have occurred if the interventions had been administered blind.	Blinding
Therefore, our findings are not universally generalizable to all patients with acute coronary syndrome.	Generalization
In that sense, the results from our study were specific to our study, and could not be generalized to include patients with non-coagulation-related syphilis (i.e., patients with non-traumatic syphilis).	Generalization
Thus, our results may not be generalisable to all patients and patients with different vascular disease, thereby restricting the generalization of the results.	Generalization
Therefore, the results of our study may not be generalizable to other participants with similar symptoms.	Generalization
Therefore, its generalisation may not be general enough.	Generalization
Our results are not generalizable to other interventions.	Generalization
Therefore, the results used by the author of this study are limited to clinical practice.	Generalization
Our results may not be applicable to other conditions in which the risk factors of obesity or chronic disease (such as triglyceride exposure) were more widely reported or more widely available.	Generalization
Therefore, generalization is necessary in the context of this study.	Generalization
The results of the current study should be applied to patients with septicemia who have normal blood pressure, but who have also had high cholesterol in the preceding 12 months.	Generalization
Moreover, the results of this study have been studied by our own team and have implications for future research.	Generalization
Furthermore, as the results of our study were evaluated on adults, it is important to include additional information relating to the impact of the use of XRS in defining the risk of acute tetanus in adults, as this is an area of clinical and etiology that could affect the results.	Generalization
The current results are limited in general to non-residents in Canada, where the study was conducted by physicians with the NIH GIRC (Balzac University).	Generalization
Therefore, we do not expect our results to be generalizable to patients with other pharmacotherapy problems.	Generalization
The result of our current study is therefore not universally generalizable.	Generalization
A longer trial duration is needed to characterize the effects of treatment, as patients were treated at shorter intervals over a shorter time period.	StudyDuration
Second, because we looked at treatment effects only on a 5-year basis, we did not examine the effect of long-term follow-up on chronic bone loss in the long term.	StudyDuration
Our longer study duration may not cover the mechanisms of benefits with the other approaches and more studies on long-term follow-up would be needed.	StudyDuration
Secondly, although this study was a prospective trial, subsequent follow-up was not possible until later in the study, which has not been done so far.	StudyDuration
Second, it was not possible to conclude that the beneficial effects of CBT alone would be maintained in the longer term, but it is possible that a further follow-up period may be needed to ensure that the efficacy of CBT is not affected by long-term exposure to CBT.	StudyDuration
The trial duration could have been shorter in order to better measure the long-term effects on oxidative stress and inflammation.	StudyDuration
Therefore, a long-term follow-up was not feasible because of the timeframe that we used for enrollment in the study.	StudyDuration
In addition, the longer duration of the study might limit the impact of these mechanisms on the long-term clinical outcome.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, our study didn't include a duration that measured measurable outcomes at the end of the treatment.	StudyDuration
In addition to limiting the effectiveness of progestogens in a short period, this study does not evaluate long-term outcomes for progestogens with long-term clinical effects.	StudyDuration
A nadir in treatment lag would have been shorter, but it would not be unlikely for patients to lose weight in the long term if long term management of this condition was initiated.	StudyDuration
Secondly, the short duration of the study would be needed to consider the possible long-term effects of oral antifungal therapy on long-term disease progression.	StudyDuration
Second, a 12-month follow-up period is required to see the clinical results of the e-tamine.	StudyDuration
A longer trial duration would have reduced the effect size of the effects seen in placebo-controlled trials.	StudyDuration
However, this study was primarily designed to assess the effects of early intervention in the primary disease process and did not include time for follow-up for primary diseases in other groups of patients.	StudyDuration
Because the primary data were accessed by end-of-dosage, it was not possible to determine the extent of occlusion in patients with an operative diagnosis in the study.	MissingData
Despite a large number of visits to the pharmacy, few patients completed the clinical assessments.	MissingData
The current trial also has high rates of participant drop-out due to the fact that there was no systematic follow-up or attrition for this treatment.	MissingData
The reluctance to participate in this study suggests a limitation to the interpretation of the data from this study, because the proportion of patients who were not in the control group were small.	MissingData
We have limited information about the outcome and this might have resulted in a smaller sample size.	MissingData
Given the small sample size, the effect on survival rates is also limited.	MissingData
Similarly, our primary results are limited to a very small proportion of study participants.	MissingData
The limitations of our results would arise from a different definition of the definition of “norm”.	MissingData
However, we do not have data for participants who had failed to complete an intervention, in particular for those who failed to complete an intervention after the completion of the first trial.	MissingData
Although some participants (and some placebo groups) did not provide laboratory or clinical assessment, these were small numbers, consistent with a high proportion of participants not finishing the study.	MissingData
Despite the high percentage of subjects disenrolled in the trial, significant differences between the two arms in the way participants reported their participation were noted.	MissingData
A significant limitation of the study is that participants chose to leave the study at any time after completing it.	MissingData
The etiological basis of these non-randomization outcomes, however, may have been due to a misunderstanding of the enrolment process.	MissingData
In addition, only one of the participants had completed all of the tasks associated with assessment of physical and psychological health.	MissingData
This study included both in-patient and out-patient patient records.	MissingData
Nevertheless, the more conservative designs, such as in the current study, resulted in a significant effect on clinical outcome, and there were no significant differences between patients treated with c-blockers (Figure 3).	Randomization
A second study of the same nature of intervention is recommended by the study investigator.	Randomization
In contrast, we do not have a clear picture of the underlying nature of our analysis, but the results were similar, even with the difference in study site (Figure 8).	Randomization
This was likely due to the fact that the two study arms were randomised independently, whereas the other arm (the p-value) is adjusted for size and therefore more likely to result from normal randomisation, but randomization is not essential for generalizability.	Randomization
Because of the small number of patients randomised in RT-PCR, a significant number of patients with severe or chronic inflammatory bowel disease had been observed after the start of therapy, so there were no effects of randomisation on the distribution of clinical variables in the study.	Randomization
While our randomization did not result in an effect size difference between groups, the effect size was still large, and significant differences in patient mortality and risk factors were present in all of our subjects, explaining the differences in patient mortality, but this may not have been the case in the overall analysis of the data.	Randomization
Interestingly, although the clinical data are highly similar across the two groups, it is not clear that the two groups were conducted independently, as it may have been due to bias.	Randomization
In addition, the inclusion of a phlebotomy group did not result in a difference in nb/qt ratios, suggesting that a shift toward a dose-dependent approach may have occurred, though this difference did not significantly change nb/qt ratio.	Randomization
Even though our results were consistent, there was a slight imbalance in doses between patients with bronchial asthma in comparison to patients with hemorrhagic fever, but we did not alter these values.	Randomization
Further, though the treatment groups were more commonly randomised, we found that fewer patients with the most severe diabetes than in other randomised groups were at risk of developing diabetes in patients with chronic high cholesterol levels, whereas the effect of this change was much larger in patients with 15 mg/dL.	Randomization
Although we did not conduct randomization, we determined that a favourable effect of standard treatment on pulmonary hypertension was obtained in the randomized group compared with that from standard control in the main randomisation, indicating a significant advantage for our main randomization.	Randomization
The effect of the randomisation effect on disease progression in the treatment arm was increased, but this increased the likelihood that the treatment arm did not differ from the other arms in terms of treatment duration.	Randomization
Because of the different methods of randomisation, the results might have been slightly different among the treatments.	Randomization
Although we had two different arm sizes (a total of six patients in one arm) despite the fact that they were randomised separately, we could not find a relationship between arm sizes in the two arm arms.	Randomization
Another limitation of randomisation was the large number of patients with CHD in both groups.	Randomization
A prospective study was not developed for the purpose of determining the impact of interventions on a number of factors such as self-reported age and gender.	StudyDesign
At least in the immediate future, a large cohort of participants may have had access to a clinical trial, but no formal informed consent has been established.	StudyDesign
Participants were not expected to fully join the study; however, it may be possible to include a 'constraint', for example by requiring a second visit by a single participant, in order to collect aggregate data.	StudyDesign
A multivariate control design imposes a number of challenges including recruitment, clustering, and final publication.	StudyDesign
A small clinical trial design has limitations in terms of potential harm.	StudyDesign
Our study design was flexible enough to allow for pragmatic design, as well as use of open-access protocols.	StudyDesign
Multivariate analysis could have introduced some new potential barriers to the study, including the need to validate the effects of randomization, trial design, and site-specific intervention variables (as well as control groups) that would limit the ability to identify potential new risk factors or explain the effects of randomization.	StudyDesign
One limitation of this study was that the protocol was not developed in a manner that allowed us to evaluate the feasibility of using prospective design methods.	StudyDesign
However, we could not have controlled for the effects of site-specific co-interventions.	StudyDesign
Our initial design did not address the issue of sample size sizing, nor did we include an exploratory factor.	StudyDesign
One potential limitation of our study design was that there were limited opportunities for administrative, administrative, and administrative reporting limitations.	StudyDesign
An exploratory design with mixed data design was used to determine if the findings would be predictive of a higher incidence of diabetes.	StudyDesign
This study introduced some new pitfalls, such as the lack of a central registry and the inability to provide an endpoint for follow-up (i.e., an evaluator could have omitted some baseline data from the data base, which would have had greater effect).	StudyDesign
This study was partially exploratory, due to the possibility of the use of multiple arms across both sites and the limited flexibility with which to analyze data.	StudyDesign
We had limited room for analysis, with some non-randomized controlled trials, and while we didn’t want to introduce a formal validation protocol, we wanted to understand potential limitations to this approach.	StudyDesign
Second, we could not observe any change in average blood pressure, cholesterol or blood pressure over the course of the study period.	MissingData
Secondly, if any of the outcome variables are changed by dietary changes, the proportions may have risen.	MissingData
Likewise, this study was not included in the reanalysis because of the limited number of patient-reported cases.	MissingData
In addition to missing and incomplete data, we could not access the full set of participants on daily basis in the study period.	MissingData
Furthermore, the absence of detailed physical examination for all patients with diabetes is also problematic because they were not available for observation or follow-up.	MissingData
Although this analysis was aimed at providing a more accurate assessment of nutrient consumption and intake, it remains possible that a limitation is due to a lack of follow-up at all time points.	MissingData
The nature of the study group and the high proportion of patients who completed the study excluded some other variables.	MissingData
One limitation of our study was the high proportion of participants who declined the acupuncture in their first week after completing the study.	MissingData
A limitation of the data collection is that only 28% of patients dropped out of the study after the end of the second arm.	MissingData
We could not evaluate for baseline or symptom severity or if clinical symptoms are related to medication use.	MissingData
Thirdly, the total number of participants not enrolled in our study (n=22) is not large enough to identify causal factors.	MissingData
Given the relatively short time required to complete the follow-up study, it is possible that some of the reported outcomes were influenced by the use of the trial, including the duration of the observation, and patient follow-up time.	MissingData
As in the case of both GWs, the nature of the GWs may have influenced the selection of intervention group.	MissingData
The lack of follow-up data is an additional limitation of the study.	MissingData
Our lack of follow-ups for the MYO1 group is due to our limited time to conduct blood and urine tests.	MissingData
Our aim was to assess the effect of intervention on perceived risk of illness.	MissingData
It is noteworthy that only one of two arms of AF/R was examined in a randomized controlled trial.	MissingData
Third, a major limitation is that only 24% of the participants had complete pulmonary function.	MissingData
To be fair, there was a significant loss of weight gain (about 2 kg) between groups 4 and 6.	MissingData
Additionally, because the clinically significant reductions in blood pressure, stroke rate and other variables were significant, we were not able to identify any significant changes in patients' baseline cholesterol, blood pressure or pulse rate after a week of study.	MissingData
Another limitation is that all clinical data for the eGadua study were based on a “hand-in” approach and could be interpreted as missing data.	MissingData
Moreover, in both study arms, the total number of participants enrolled was not standardized, due to the number of participants who joined each group.	MissingData
A limitation of our analysis is that the proportion of participants who attended a hospital within one year of receiving therapy was relatively small.	MissingData
There is evidence that this effect has been accounted for by a substantial relapse in missing data.	MissingData
We have no record of the study participants despite repeated attempt to contact the clinical staff with complaints.	MissingData
We also did not provide all required anthropometric and laboratory variables with the exception of age.	MissingData
Nevertheless, this study was small, with only 67 participants with information on their dietary intake.	MissingData
The lower number of patients dropped out of the study, and the larger sample size of the remaining patients may also have influenced the outcome.	MissingData
This observation was particularly challenging as patients who left the trial before the end of the trial reported that they could not remember their study durations in the study, suggesting a potential bias.	MissingData
Additionally, we could not collect patient-reported blood glucose over time.	MissingData
However, an observational study with a high number of hgb levels in a second arm in a clinical trial with only one intervention had significantly different effects on survival than one of the two arm in the larger study (P=0.041).	Randomization
In addition, it is important to note that, although the data is not random, the distribution of diabetes in each centre is probably quite similar in both groups, indicating that the effect of patient education on adverse outcomes may differ.	Randomization
Although we analyzed all four variables independently, we found that the design of the study was not random; the difference between the two studies is small (0.1–0.3%), and our findings from our randomization may not have been influenced by the slant bias.	Randomization
Although we used an uncontrolled design, significant intergroup heterogeneity between the two groups was present, despite the fact that the two groups were compared in the same way.	Randomization
Among the different groups of patients with dyslipidemia, the distribution of HbA1c was unbalanced.	Randomization
However, we found that patients with significant BMI had a higher risk of death and cardiovascular events.	Randomization
However, a significant number of confounds and significant differences were found in the patients in whom the regimens were randomised.	Randomization
Because of the naivety effect, the number of patients enrolled in our intervention tended to be more variable than that of the control group.	Randomization
However, since the e-test results were derived from a single centre, there is evidence that a bias for the centre-controlled study was present.	Randomization
We are aware that randomization with a smaller number of patients was not possible, but it could have been a factor influencing these outcomes.	Randomization
Given the small sample size, we could not adjust for the effect of randomization on risk of pulmonary embolism in the patients in the randomised trial.	Randomization
However, the larger number of patients who received the acupuncture arm (more than 80) compared with the 260 control subjects compared with the 316 in the radial arm group (Figure 2) suggests that although there is significant re-sampling in the radial arm, no effect of randomization was observed.	Randomization
However, despite the presence of two primary outcome variables, the two analyses did not randomize, thus causing significant differences between the two treatment groups.	Randomization
This is a result of the large number of data from three randomizations, although we had not considered this to affect the number of deaths in this sample.	Randomization
This is due to the fact that the patients with BMI and BMI-D were treated with a dose of metformin, and this bias was exacerbated by the inconsistency of the treatment protocols.	Randomization
We also had to implement a randomised study.	StudyDesign
The exploratory nature of our study could introduce significant limitations, including the need to adopt a design of no more than one study (SCE) to a low-powered population.	StudyDesign
Because the primary endpoint was the outcome, we had no way to specify how the clinical trial was set up or whether we wanted to use it in our evaluation.	StudyDesign
This was a pilot-only study, but it is likely to be modified in the future as a larger study might be more appropriate.	StudyDesign
Additionally, although there is little data from the study, the study was not limited to study designs with minimal publication requirements.	StudyDesign
Randomization is an important component of a randomised controlled trial, and we were unable to test the effect of clustering and use the data only for exploratory analysis.	StudyDesign
First, it was not feasible to implement a randomized trial.	StudyDesign
Furthermore, the primary endpoint was randomization (n = 21).	StudyDesign
Furthermore, while this study is highly exploratory, it could introduce significant challenges in the future such as the inclusion and exclusion of participants or a need for final documentation.	StudyDesign
Multilevel and large-scale studies are difficult to implement.	StudyDesign
Second, the randomization design made use of a trial-like design that could be a bit limiting in its use, e.g. random sampling to assess risk factors for TB and hemorrhagic stroke.	StudyDesign
Randomized controlled trials are typically a form of pragmatic evaluation that are not intended to be large-scale.	StudyDesign
Moreover, the inclusion of a formal secondary endpoint, the study design, and the use of an open enrollment design make a practical consideration when implementing a prospective cohort study.	StudyDesign
A larger study could reduce the ability for a single centre to conduct a randomised controlled trial (which is not feasible if a small group of urologists was included).	StudyDesign
Although we are using the randomized design principle, the study was not designed for a prospective randomization; we were interested in allowing for the possibility of exploratory designs.	StudyDesign
Moreover, the assessment of patients' responses to the intervention might not have been blinded and participants may not have been blinded to their corresponding interventions.	Blinding
Alternatively, participants may not have been blinded to the interventions they received, or may not have had the same effect, which would have been achieved if they were blinded to the intervention.	Blinding
Some clinicians could have had an interest in how well the interventions were received by patients and reported any alterations in outcomes.	Blinding
In the absence of blinding, the outcome data would have been not blinded (unmasking).	Blinding
The aim of the study was not to blind participants to the intervention but rather to observe their clinical behaviour during each treatment session.	Blinding
First, the clinicians may have influenced participants' results, or had a favourable perception of the intervention at an earlier stage.	Blinding
The present study was conducted unblinded and the participants were not blinded to the intervention, and so the results from the blinded study may be difficult to interpret.	Blinding
Alternatively, it would be important to assess the quality of the assessment, since the effect of a treatment effect is often unmaskingly observed.	Blinding
In addition, it is likely that participants in the current trial (at the time of implantation) were not blinded to the outcome.	Blinding
The participants may have self-reported that they did not know who was in the intervention group (this is known as self-reporting bias).	Blinding
The trial was not blinded.	Blinding
An important consideration is whether patients are blinded to the intervention in the primary care setting.	Blinding
However, the HCIM questionnaires were not blinded in clinical assessments, so that there was no need to introduce extra monitoring during treatment, although the data were anonymised, but patients could have had their confidence influenced.	Blinding
First, participants were not blinded by the study assistants, but the clinical recording system used in the study did have some unmasking factors, but these effects could have hampered the measurement of participant blinding.	Blinding
In addition, the study protocol, which was standardized by the pharmacologists, did not include a self-assessment of the patient’s preference for snorting, which in turn could have influenced the outcomes (see discussion below).	Blinding
We have not assessed the clinical efficacy of c-metacalcium for acute stress fractures, which are associated with the risk of developing acute stress fractures.	StudyDuration
In contrast to longer clinical trials, which focus more on short-term improvements in condition severity, shorter duration is less relevant for measuring changes in treatment effects.	StudyDuration
Another limitation of the current clinical trials is the length of time of follow-up; however, in addition to the short duration of follow-up it appears that it could be necessary to conclude that early intervention may be required to achieve the desired effects of an oral medication.	StudyDuration
Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that this observation will be repeated in the long term, because of the strong dose-response relationship observed in the long term clinical trials.	StudyDuration
Finally, a longer duration was needed to evaluate the effects of the topical treatments for this condition.	StudyDuration
First, although longer term follow-up was not intended to address the clinical issues with treatment adherence in the immediate aftermath of the implantation, follow-up period would have been useful in determining which therapies were more effective.	StudyDuration
However, we did not include a short time point to measure the effectiveness of oral morphine in regulating CRP levels, which might not have prevented its use in the rat model.	StudyDuration
A longitudinal design is necessary because the main effect of placebo on outcome is often felt only at the start of treatment, whereas shorter follow-up periods are less favourable.	StudyDuration
The study duration may be too short to reach definitive conclusions about how the therapeutic effects of angiogenesis drugs may develop over long-term follow-up.	StudyDuration
A longer study would be needed to determine the beneficial effect of a longer course of glucocorticoids on long-term disease severity, because long-term follow-up is needed for longer-term management.	StudyDuration
Finally, we did not have time for follow up of the results and thus it is impossible to conclude that the full therapeutic effect of GNP could be achieved after three years.	StudyDuration
Third, the duration of the study was relatively short (three months) and it is possible that these benefits may not become apparent in later studies.	StudyDuration
Further, in addition to the effect of the phenobarbital treatment on lipid metabolism, lipid retention may also be improved over longer time frames.	StudyDuration
Thus, if we were to establish efficacy at a dose of 4 months it would be important to consider the length of time between intervention and its effects.	StudyDuration
Furthermore, long-term follow-up of the effects of lithium might be needed to establish long-term effects on long-term disability.	StudyDuration
In addition, long-term follow-up would be more informative for defining the value of our results, and would allow our investigators to gain some experience in taking care of our patients.	StudyDuration
Considering the timescale, it is probably not appropriate to examine the potential effects of the tachytrol treatment on disease progression in a long-term intervention trial.	StudyDuration
Third, the study was not long enough to determine how long the effects of folic acid on oral vitamin D were sustained, but in any case, it is likely that the effect was sustained over a longer duration.	StudyDuration
It was not possible to evaluate long-term effects of CHD treatment in this study.	StudyDuration
A single-year follow-up would be needed to confirm its value for long-term use.	StudyDuration
Further, it was observed that only three months later than baseline for the treatment of lupus might have the effect to remove a lupus prophylactic effect, which was a characteristic of the current treatment.	StudyDuration
However, in addition to the shorter duration of the follow-up period, the study did not follow long-term follow-up, and so was difficult to evaluate the effect of long-term treatment on recurrent osteoporosis.	StudyDuration
Second, although our clinical trials are shorter in length, we cannot exclude a long-term pharmacokinetic effect.	StudyDuration
First, the duration of the study was not long enough to determine the impact of the long-term pharmacotherapy on bone health.	StudyDuration
Moreover, an extended follow-up was needed to detect the long-term effects of this treatment.	StudyDuration
We concluded that if we were to assess the efficacy of prophylactic therapy over longer periods, a longer period of follow-up would be beneficial.	StudyDuration
Although the study duration was short, it was not clear if the benefit of CRT was prolonged in the long-term.	StudyDuration
Finally, the study ended relatively early, making it difficult to study whether the effects of DMF were sustained or short-term.	StudyDuration
The study did not test the effects of anti-epileptic drug treatment on oral dose but the longer follow up would have been needed to understand long-term effects of treatment.	StudyDuration
However, there is no time-frame limitation on the effect of thyroxine on the onset of leukaemia in 6-month follow-up following administration of the active form of thyroxine.	StudyDuration
This limitation limits the application of our study to the general population.	Generalization
Thus, the results should be interpreted only with the patients who received the NSLV, not with the study participants.	Generalization
This may limit the validity of the findings for other participants with DHBs in the field.	Generalization
A major limitation of our study was that it only referred to the main clinical group of patients with bfs.	Generalization
Finally, the study only applies to adults with comorbid mental illness in the Netherlands, i.e.	Generalization
As such, our findings may not generalize to all patients, especially those with higher BMI.	Generalization
Third, it is important that the results from our study are not generalized to all patients with similar clinical profile.	Generalization
A study may not be generalizable to patients from other settings.	Generalization
Our study was therefore limited to only patients who showed increased levels of thrombophlebitis associated with the opportunistic infection.	Generalization
In addition, because our findings were specific to the vascular stroke, our results do not have any generalizability to other vascular diseases.	Generalization
The results presented may be generalizable in other settings or in particular to the acute phase (eg, asymptomatic acute lung injury) and despite these limitations, the findings could not be generalized to the acute phase of sarcolepsy.	Generalization
This study is specific to the US neurologist, but it was not tested on individuals from the drexel group and may not apply to other neurologist.	Generalization
Third, the results could not be generalized to patients with diabetes in other areas.	Generalization
Our findings could not be extended to other settings, so the findings are not generalizable to other non-clinical conditions, and may not be generalizable to other non-clinical conditions.	Generalization
Therefore, it is important for future studies to verify the results of our findings in an outpatient setting.	Generalization
The findings described here are applicable to patients who have not received chemotherapy or have received the ivf.	Generalization
Second, because the LTSS was limited to adults, we would not recommend generalizing the findings here to adult patients at other ages.	Generalization
The results of this study are unique in that they apply only to patients referred to the center.	Generalization
Therefore, this data may not be generalisable to others.	Generalization
Our results can only be generalized to the clinical situation and we cannot assume that these results can be generalized to other clinical situations.	Generalization
A key limitation of this study is that the results are not generalizable to the larger population.	Generalization
The results may not necessarily apply to the general population in which a treatment intervention is administered, or to a group of patients with more advanced obstructive pulmonary disease who have a higher risk of death (20% vs. 9% in the general population).	Generalization
Therefore, the use of the present study may not be generalisable to other cohorts, and so this study is not yet generalizable to non-emerging-patients.	Generalization
A second limitation of the HCGI study is that its findings are relevant only for patients with CRS.	Generalization
Second, because we used only one clinically proven, human blood group, the results of this study cannot be generalized to any other patient.	Generalization
This may result in potential limitations regarding generalization in light of our specific findings.	Generalization
This study was only relevant to patients with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and should not be generalized to all patients in the clinical setting, as the results are only based on a small group of patients.	Generalization
However, we caution that this is a data-based study and thus may not apply to all cases.	Generalization
Therefore, the current results are limited in their generalization.	Generalization
Our results have been evaluated with participants who had normal weight, compared to patients with more severe weight loss (e.g.	Generalization
Neither control group and the CCGs were randomised equally, though the first-line differences were more pronounced in the CCGs group.	Randomization
Despite this, the results from randomisation of BDM-SLDs with normal heartbeat are significantly different from those obtained from the study in the non-randomised study.	Randomization
A critical limitation of this study is that the two groups were randomly allocated with similar treatment effects.	Randomization
While the number of patients in the randomised study was significantly higher, it is impossible to estimate how many patients of the randomisation were matched between the two groups.	Randomization
However, despite a small number of covariates (n = 82), the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy in the same age group was not statistically significant (n = 105).	Randomization
Because the patients were randomly assigned for all interventions, the mean dose variation in all groups was slightly higher in both studies, but this resulted from larger data sizes, and from a more consistent effect on death rates.	Randomization
While the authors simulated the effects of nephrotoxicity using the Fenn-Britán scale, the findings from our study indicate that the effect of nephrotoxicity on the effect size of the effect in HCV may be greater than expected.	Randomization
One limitation is that we used only the CFS model which accounted for all uncorrected differences between dilated-ectopic patients in the study, which could have contributed to the differences found.	Randomization
Due to the nature of the study, we cannot assess the effects of other randomisation groups, because we found a significant influence on the number of study sites in the study.	Randomization
But this result may be due to the different treatment protocols, so the randomization of the patients is less well balanced in this study than in the control group.	Randomization
This is due to the small number of groups in which equating patients who did not receive antibiotic treatment were randomized, which made the comparison complicated.	Randomization
However, as this study is unsupervised, we are unable to determine the effects of randomisation on outcome.	Randomization
However, because the difference in the baseline BMI between two groups of patients was small, this effect may have been influenced by randomization in an overlapping manner (Table 1).	Randomization
Although it is logical to assume a statistically different treatment group, it is less logical to assume a more standardised treatment regimen.	Randomization
However, a substantial dose of placebo was found for all patients (p=0.017) and so a statistically significant effect was expected.	Randomization
Because our analysis included multiple regressions, there is potential for multiple causative interactions that are not analyzed.	StatisticalAnalysis
As we did not control for multiple other variables, our analysis could not have predicted the possible outcome of the test.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, the high number of multiple groups in our statistical analysis might indicate that we failed to adjust for other possible associations (e.g., stroke, anxiety, depression).	StatisticalAnalysis
As we did not test for any extracorporeal neurotransmitters, this may be due to the fact that we treated them all separately.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, our multiple choice analysis approach to the risk assessment of stroke risk may be limited by its smaller sample size, and the potential for other unpredicted mechanisms to affect stroke risk could limit the assessment.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we randomized our tests, we could have excluded unrelated secondary outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Another limitation of our approach is the lack of a multiple analysis analysis, which can cause unexpected results.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, we did not adjust for multiple independent factors and may have underestimated the potential impact of other life events.	StatisticalAnalysis
Another potential bias is the fact that we did not test for rp levels in depression, which is associated with positive mental health outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we tested all groups of potential drivers, we did not adjust for the effect of age, and there are significant differences in weight gain.	StatisticalAnalysis
However, as one effect of the adjusting procedure, we were not able to analyze multiple variables; furthermore, our analysis of underlying mechanisms of the disease could be a limitation due to the nature of our analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
This could be due to the fact that we did not assess all variables independently, but we expected this result to be significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, multiple independent outcomes were tested, and the results may not be robust.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, although we did not make any statistical significance tests, the results were not significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we did not adjust for multiple factors, the effects on CB could be confounded by an error of 55%.	StatisticalAnalysis
In the event of a placebo-controlled assessment, the investigators would not have blinded the researchers to the intervention, so it may not be completely unexpected if they choose to apply a blinding scheme.	Blinding
Although participants were blinded, the nature of the intervention was not known.	Blinding
Another limitation is the large variability between participants, and it is possible that bias from self-reporting of the outcomes could have occurred in the treatment group, thus limiting the effectiveness of observational studies (non-blinding).	Blinding
Because participants were not blinded to the intervention, there was some uncertainty about whether participants had acquired an adverse reaction.	Blinding
The participants in the ACG were not blinded to the intervention they received in the acute setting.	Blinding
Because of this, the clinicians would have omitted some participants from the study, thereby creating a potential hazard of misinterpretation.	Blinding
However, when using a standardised single dose syringe, participants were not blinded and so the trial was not possible to identify the participants by the participants' names or phone numbers.	Blinding
The clinical team might not have been as blind as the participants did, due to the possibility of randomisation to a third interventionist.	Blinding
In an observational study with patients receiving a double-blinding protocol, the treatment was likely to have been unblinded.	Blinding
The study team did not blind participants, and therefore, it is difficult to assess whether patients are unaware of the intervention.	Blinding
Although a study-wide blinding was used, the participants were not blinded to what they were learning.	Blinding
Another limitation of the intervention may have been the perception of treatment bias, if the intervention was administered blindly.	Blinding
In the absence of clinician blinding, it is not possible to determine whether the intervention was double blind, as only the investigators (and patient participants) were blinded to whether they did or did not receive a dose (see section 7.3.2).	Blinding
However, the administration of the same intervention would have led to a different result from the blinded trial, and this would have been achieved by using a similar blinding device and the following modifications.	Blinding
A study blinding could not be performed at the end of the 6-month follow-up period.	Blinding
Finally, as all of the outcomes were grouped by chance, there may have been some uncertainty regarding the effects of different measures of age and mental health.	StatisticalAnalysis
The higher probability of secondary endpoints, however, could be due to the a priori nature of our analysis, such as a broader network of events, but also due to our sensitivity analysis.	StatisticalAnalysis
Although we performed a randomized sham-test, our results were subject to chance and chance tests, which make it challenging to extrapolate causal relationships.	StatisticalAnalysis
Finally, the tests we performed were not all related to cognitive changes, indicating that there were some non-computational effects on cognitive performance, but none that we could test for.	StatisticalAnalysis
Furthermore, we did not control for other independent factors that would influence the outcome.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we adjusted our sensitivity and specificity assumptions, the impact of multiple outcomes could be potentially greater in the longer term.	StatisticalAnalysis
In addition, we used multiple measures of depression to determine the association between stress, anxiety and depression.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, our multiple analysis technique enables us to exclude potential interactions between multiple primary outcomes.	StatisticalAnalysis
Because we did not test for CVD at baseline, multiple logistic regression analysis could have introduced additional differences in CVD.	StatisticalAnalysis
Third, we had multiple comparisons among variables that affected the average OD in TS, but we had not analyzed the results for other variables.	StatisticalAnalysis
Nonetheless, we had a number of independent variables tested, which would have resulted in smaller numbers of conclusions.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, we did not adjust for covariates in our analyses, but we expected covariates to be significant.	StatisticalAnalysis
Moreover, we did not examine multiple factors for assessing risk of suicide.	StatisticalAnalysis
Additionally, we did not examine multiple confounding factors in establishing the LSCA threshold.	StatisticalAnalysis
Second, we conducted multiple tests that might have altered the conclusion.	StatisticalAnalysis
A limitation of this study is the omission of a secondary outcome to measure the effect of dietary supplements on lipid levels in healthy adults.	MissingData
First, we could not obtain any anthropometric data for our study participants resulting from an assessment of their baseline anthropometry.	MissingData
The size of the study and the absence of routine laboratory studies did not allow us to estimate the absolute number of patients in each treatment arm.	MissingData
Furthermore, it is unlikely that this limitation on the number of missed data may be attributed to the absence of a medical necessity for completing the study.	MissingData
However, in the last follow-up survey of patients (n=21), we found a considerable decrease in mean total time between intake and discontinuation of treatment for C-section.	MissingData
The study included two time points where the doses were changed, or the daily duration of administration, and there was no further follow up.	MissingData
Our main limitation of this trial is our unwillingness to have prospectively measured baseline CRP values for all treatment variables in all subjects.	MissingData
At the completion of the study, the majority of study participants did not complete at least two additional tasks.	MissingData
A limitation of the current study was the low number of missing patient records.	MissingData
Our patient-reported daily mean weight loss was 37%.	MissingData
One limitation is that participants chose not to complete the follow-up questionnaires after they had completed the clinical assessment.	MissingData
We also lacked data on adherence to the drug therapy.	MissingData
Second, a limited number of participants from the control group were not included in the assessment.	MissingData
In addition, we did not collect a detailed profile of participants who responded to the study, although some participants did not respond to all of the tests, and furthermore, some participants were not able to provide any information on the effect of the intervention.	MissingData
Additionally, we have a high proportion of study discontinuation, which would have been unexpected as a result of the randomization effect.	MissingData
Notably, a lack of detailed follow-up data would have been important as this relates to the size of the randomized trials.	MissingData
One limitation of this study is that participants in the randomized, multicentre, placebo-controlled study were unable to report data on dietary intake and body weight.	MissingData
We have limited data for anthropometric measurements, particularly blood glucose (> 0.02 mg/dL), glucocorticoid levels, and total serum calcium (0.8 g/dL).	MissingData
We also had a large number of participants who did not complete the whole study.	MissingData
Third, we were unable to obtain any data on how well the children responded to nutritional interventions.	MissingData
This is due to the limited number of available participants in the first arm of the trial.	MissingData
The high drop-out rate may have been related to a high number of patients withdrawing from the study.	MissingData
Furthermore, the absence of blood glucose levels during a study visit reduced our assessment of the severity of comorbid conditions.	MissingData
Furthermore, we did not obtain data on the effects of radiation and the types of exposure.	MissingData
Although the repercussions of this trial were not clear, it is unlikely that the patient who was disenrolled from the study has been kept in the registry for this purpose (Durand, 1991).	MissingData
In the first cohort, only 79% of patients had a complete medical history.	MissingData
As with the other intervention groups, only non-responders to the study were contacted.	MissingData
One limitation of the current study is that there was no data on the frequency and duration of exposure.	MissingData
Similarly, the patient data for BMI (bbms) were comparatively small (average of 4.9%).	MissingData
The inclusion of a primary swab in the DRM1 study did not change over time, indicating a lingering effect of loss of vital information due to medical complications of radiation therapy.	MissingData

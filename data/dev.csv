PMC4647309,21492,"These data are crucial since the homogeneous neointima pattern correlated in earlier reports with a high proportion of connective tissue and smooth muscle cells in histopathology indicating favorable vessel healing, whereas, heterogenous neointima was found to correlate with higher presence of fibrin as compared to homogenous one and was associated with poorer clinical outcomes.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC4647309,21493,"Also the layered neointima corresponded with peristrut inflammation, and a small proportion of layered neointima suggested a lower inflammatory response to BP-DES as compared with DP-DES [34, 35].",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5070122,34564,We believe that the simple structure of the intervention with only three required visits to the hospital and the flexibility the two assessors displayed in changing assessment schedules in cases of flare was reflected in the good retention rates.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5070122,34565,"Only one participant dropped out due to flare, which was expected due to the fluctuating character of the disease.",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5702102,25544,Sixty-four (22%) of participants in the JCP arm did not complete a JCP.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25545,"These participants were similar in most respects to those who did, but tended to have had more psychiatric admissions in the two years prior to the trial, have a higher engagement with care (SES) score and higher clinician-rated working alliance (WAIT).",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5702102,25550,There was no bivariate association between having had an involuntary admission in the two years prior to baseline assessment or service user-rated working alliance and treatment refusal.,False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5702102,25553,The results indicate that there is no association between working alliance or involuntary admission and advance treatment refusals.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25554,"The association between perceived coercion and advance refusals remains significant when other factors are accounted for (odds ratio = 1.34, 95% CI 1.07–1.69, p = 0.013).",False,[0],[0],[0]

PMC5702102,25556,Discussion,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25557,Summary of findings,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25558,Comparison of the rates of advance refusals made in JCPs with those made in CPA forms among trial participants shows that the potential demand for refusals is barely addressed by the current CPA process used in routine care.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25559,Our results also suggest that most refusals made using the JCP were not out of keeping with what the clinicians viewed as safe clinical practice.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25560,"In no cases did clinicians attending the JCP meetings disagree with the refusals made, although it should be noted that this does not mean all refusals were then followed in practice.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25561,"It is also possible that clinicians did not voice their concerns during the meetings (despite being asked for their views by the facilitator), as suggested by qualitative interviews of some participating clinicians [22].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25562,They may instead have wanted to avoid an argument with the service user and/or have judged the process to be non-binding.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25563,"Thus, knowing that refusals made under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 can be overridden using the Mental Health Act may reduce the attention paid by clinicians to refusals made by serviced users, despite the possibility of honouring a refusal (such as that of a particular medication) while someone is detained under the Mental Health Act.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25564,"Among those who received a JCP, higher perceived coercion at baseline was associated with subsequent treatment refusal, as hypothesised.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25565,"However, no association was found with having a previous involuntary admission or working alliance and subsequent treatment refusal.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25566,"The association with duration of contact with mental health services, along with the lack of association with involuntary admission or working alliance, suggests that many refusals are made based on experiences of treatments regardless of whether these were experienced while detained under the Mental Health Act.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25567,Participant location at the sites outside London was also associated with treatment refusal.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25568,"This may indicate differences in implementation of the JCP development process among the sites on the part of the facilitators, despite the provision of supervision of all facilitators by the same member of the research team.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25569,"A second possibility is the existence of site level differences in participants’ past experiences of treatment, which were not captured in the assessment and exclude use of the Mental Health Act per se, but which give rise to higher rates of treatment refusal.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25570,Limitations of the study,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25571,"While the JCP intervention allowed us to assess demand for treatment refusals and their relationship with clinical and demographic factors, the sample was subject to the eligibility criteria for the CRIMSON trial.",True,['the sample was subject to the eligibility criteria for the CRIMSON trial'],['VerySpecificPopulation'],['Population']
PMC5702102,25572,This took place in three urban and one rural area within the three sites and included only those with an admission in the last two years; the sample is therefore not fully representative of adults with psychoses using secondary mental health services in England.,True,['the sample is therefore not fully representative of adults with psychoses using secondary mental health services in England'],['VerySpecificPopulation'],['Population']
PMC5702102,25573,"Further, we are unable to report the extent to which refusals were honoured due to the CRIMSON trial resource limitations.",True,['we are unable to report the extent to which refusals were honoured'],['MissingData'],['MissingData']
PMC5702102,25574,Conclusions,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25575,"Our findings are consistent with previous research showing there is strong demand for psychiatric advance statements [23–25] and that the content of most advance statements can be followed without compromising care [6, 25, 26].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25576,"However, most of those who want to make a statement need support to complete it [5, 27], and despite the existence of UK legislation for advance refusals, services offer no systematic or efficient way of providing this support.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25577,We have thus highlighted an aspect of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 which has been under-implemented in mental health services.,False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25578,"The creation of, access to, and honouring of individualised crisis plans which include refusals are important in their own right but are missing from current care pathways [4].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25579,"The research evidence is clear that interventions such as Joint Crisis Plans and facilitated psychiatric advance directives are an effective way to inform service users of their legal rights to make advance treatment refusals; they probably also improve working alliance with clinicians [13, 24].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25580,"Evidence that these interventions can lead to ‘harder’ outcomes such as reduced use of involuntary treatment [28] and for their cost-effectiveness [12, 29] is more mixed, and may reflect problems in implementation.11 However, a recent systematic review identified advance statements as the only intervention associated with reduction in the use of compulsory treatment [28].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25581,"Further work is needed to identify ways to overcome barriers to the creation of advance statements, together with study of the outcomes associated with not just their creation but of their application in routine practice.",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25582,"Recently arguments have been presented that involuntary detention and treatment under mental health legislation be like that for general health care, that is, based on impaired decision-making capacity and best interests [30].",False,[0],[0],[0]
PMC5702102,25583,"In such a case, a treatment refusal could not be ‘trumped’ by mental health legislation.",False,[0],[0],[0]
